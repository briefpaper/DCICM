			<RelCBody>For family with 2 child, you ll probably need 2BR flat which will cost about 7000-8000 and for schooling you ll probably need 4000-5000. so it means these two will take major chunk of your salary. Further you can take 3000 monthly living expense and 2000 for conveyance. Additionally any medical requirements. Now its upto you to decide...</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Aamirjaved's calculation is somewhat on the high side. I believe you should be able to get a 2BR within QR 5000 and also you can easily manage your monthly expenses within QR 2000. For the schooling, if you are an Asian, it is not that costly to my understanding. As such, my view is that if you are an Asian, grab the offer; but if you are a westerner, kick it. </RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>We can't say if it's a good deal - you don't include details of the role.


Try to get schooling included in the package.


Agree with aamirjaved. Depends on what standard of living you want. Depending on area, you may need 10k+ for a nice 2 bed.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Because there are not too much specialty stores that caters only professional cameras (DSLRs). Mostly camera stores can be found only in malls but they are not specialty stores.

1st Lane = Speed Limit+20 ( Slow down when you see radar)
2nd Lane = Speed Limit+ ( Slow down when you see radar)

Overtaking is allowed from both sides in some areas, especially when police is not around.
while near to Roundabout, decide on which side you have to go, and then select the proper lane.

They very seldom leave those areas, hence the reason you probably have never seen a &amp;quot;Learner&amp;quot; driver.

At the end no one is taking the stress but you.

That's how I've been driving here since last 20 years :)

How you accomplish that is totally upto you. 


Hopefully we can start a chain reaction with that and then it will really be pleasant for everyone on the road in our time :)

This workshop deals with lots of insurance companies and its price is very reasonable.

I am not making any advertisement for anyone, I even forgot the name of the garage. However I have the guys tel. no and if you are interested I will give it to you.

Try to also check other workshops to compare between price/quality/time to finish the works.</RelCBody>

Is it possible to change the wifes sponsorship to Husbands, without the consents of Wifes presnt employer. ( I mean , wife wants to resign the job against the wishes of Employer. And she wants to be housewife under husbands sponsorship. Can the prsent employer of the wife play havoc ? ..Can he stop her doing so ?....

This is not an hypothetical question. One of my friend really wants to know. Since she could not get an authentic answer, not able to resign.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>correct... just follow what darude's suggest...

1&amp;gt; get married.

2&amp;gt; once handed the marriage documents, let your wife to ask from his current Sponsor to change sponsorship to HUSBAND SPONSORSHIP, u may do that instantly or upon expiry of you wife's visa. your wife can still continue with her current job without leaving the country.

3&amp;gt;ask for Mandoub services to do the job, it is only a simple paperwork to change sponsorship.

4&amp;gt;if your wife wishes to quit the job, she may do so... so many reasons to tell the previous sponsor for quiting the job like she is pregnant... after giving birth reasons like she needs to care for you infant.

			<RelCBody>Hi ditto,


Sorry to estate the obvious and if I sound a little patronasing, but couldn't your back pain be related to the fact that you are pregnant??? If so I think is best if you leave it untreated, I used to have a lot of pain in my back too and it dissapeared after giving birth. It is normal, it doesn't mean that there is something &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; with your back.

Anyways, there are lots of doctors here. The Hammad women hospital is very good and have modern equipment, I was treated there.. I also heard  very good things about Al Emadi and the Doha Clinic. I did try the American Hospital and didn't like it at all.


Women Hospital: 439 6666
Al Emadi: 466 6009
Doha Clinic: 432 7300
Doha Chripractic Centre: 4650012

HOpe that helps.

			<RelCBody>hello ditto, i do think you need to see a chiropractor, and if you do have back pain of course it means there is something wrong with your back.  SInce you are pregnant your pelvis is expanding which causes pain in your lumbar and pelvic also due to the extra weight.  Therefore the best treatment for you is chiropractic, its not only for your back pain but also for optimum health of the baby and you.The chiropractic approach to better health is to detect,reduce,and help pervent nervous system dysfunction.  </RelCBody>

This is common problem as this hospital.  I have heard of people waiting more than 1 hours for scheduled appointments.  Scheduling the appointment is often difficult and disorganized also.  Hopefully if enough complain they will improve, but best solution is for new private hospitals to open to create competition.</RelCBody>

Do remember that all units of hamad hospital do not have a strict appointment system, you just go there early and take the token and wait for your turn. It can take half and hour to almost an hour and half to see the doctor.

 A villa might sound to be big, but, how many are to share the villa ? And who is paying for your air travel ?

Shared accomodation = shared food + shared communication expenses + shared expense over sightseeing or going out.

Hmmph...While everyone is entitled to his/her own views, my view is that your package is a tad low and you have to really think through to save something.

Or would even then the Bad &amp;amp; The Good could be separated?

It's in our genes from the people behind us. But if we teach the next generation that there is no such thing as a &amp;quot;lie&amp;quot;, what would happen?

Secondly, the optimist would suggest that by the action the Russians have drawn the line and the Americans will now think twice about interference in other regions where Russia may have a presence.

			<RelCBody>How can it be old news??? The two reports (yours and mine) are from the same day, year, month.... They are only a few hours apart.

Just shows that Georgia needs to stop listening to what they are being told. They say they are taking control and the U.S. says a few hours later they aren't. Yeaaa they also thought the US and nato would bail them out. They aren't just making up this stuff as they go along. Someone is making them promises behind closed doors and breaking them publicly.</RelCBody>

Common cense tells me:
If QTEL has not blocked those web sites, I'm not saying Is right or wrong, I keep my neutrality on that issue. Then keep on doing what ever you are doing with torrents.

Know by posting the topic in public forum and QL uses the portal of Qtel, then you are risking the possibilities for them blocking them. They do monitor this public web site.

			<RelCBody>torrenting is not illegal.

Vista for example has torrenting built in. So does the Opera browser.

You don't blame the system, you blame the people who abuse it.

You can't say the internet is illegal because there's porn, it's the people who put the porn online :P

Anyway, I use uTorrent.

On my 2mb connection I get around 2.8mb download.

			<RelCBody>DW, not sure if it will affect your speed or not. Depends on too many things along the &amp;quot;pipe&amp;quot; it guess. It could help the ports issue, but as I said earlier I have no issue with UTorrent on the normal DSL so have not moved to fibre yet.

It definitely helps with the &amp;quot;waving finger&amp;quot; on blocked websites.

You can try one of the VPNs for a month - I think prices are around $10 - I used www.overplay.net a while ago. It was easy to pay with paypal (and then stop the subscription via paypal)</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>It's better if you use original software only....good for you, your pc...and after all for the company who spent millions in research to creat a software for you.

However, if you are still hooked on pirated, there is a beter option to download from free download servers...just type Software Name + Torrent in search box and you will get what you are looking for.....lol

			<RelCBody>Less or more, piracy is everywhere. Don't say that only Indians are doing this.  The software you mentioned to download audio/video stuff and books from the internet, certainly would not be from India and the stuff that is copied on Torrents (as I mentioned in an earlier thread) is also not copied by Indians only. Most of the tools to get pirated stuff online are invented in those developed countries where giant software companies are battling against piracy in underdeveloped countries.

So, don't blame a particular country. Just fight against Piracy as it is illegal and not good, no matter where is it.

Use &amp;quot;uTorrent&amp;quot; as your torrents client ..
Use something like &amp;quot;www.mininova.org&amp;quot; or any other website that has loads of torrents on it ..

			<RelCBody>King is right. Utorrent (www.utorrent.com) is the best and simplest torrent client. Once downloaded you just need to install it and then use the search engine on the top right hand side of the interface to search for whatever you want to download (i.e just type the name of the movie). It will take you the mininova.org and once there it is a good idea to sort the findigs by clicking on the heading SEEDS. This will sort it so the movie or program with the highest number of seeders will show first. This guarantees you a higher speed as &amp;quot;higher number of seeders = greater speed&amp;quot;.
Hope this helps.
Other good sites are:
demonoid.com
torrentz.com
torrent.to
but the one i use for movies is:
www.torrentfive.com

			<RelCBody>Dude, there is no such thing as &amp;quot;free movies&amp;quot;.
What you are refereeing to as &amp;quot;free movies download&amp;quot; is in fact the illegal download of copyrighted movies, better known as PIRACY.
FYI, piracy is a crime punishable by law. Thus, the fastest way to acquire movies is to BUY them.

			<RelCBody>agree to pal... if u want faster, legal ownership of movies, u buy it. but ofcourse there's some for promotional, personal and education use... it's all up to you on how you treat those movies u download.

also, it depends on wat type of movies, mostly new and current ones are basically illegal, but for those old but goodies are somehow permitted to share online.

for those type of movies, i suggests two things:
first, for online viewing... there are youtube, veoh, google videos, megavideo, joox, supernovatube, imeem etc. that u could check and watch some movies

second, u could download it (as this is what you ask for right?) using different methods; some like, you could use website assistance like keepvid, clipnabber, file2hd, splandoo, downloadflv, mediapirate, feelingtea, video downloader, and many more to check from. just copy and paste the link of video you required to those website and press ok or get or whatever it mentioned there then the original link of the movie will be shown... after you could use download assitance software or use the default  download function of your browser.

hope it helps you, but be sure to be responsible for your downloads since most of them has virus, worms and the likes that maybe harm your pc. it also present in torrent methods that's why i suggested first to only watch online rather to download it. it also save some space on your harddrive too.


if you need further assitance you may pm me, hope i could reply back soon. :)</RelCBody>

First, you need to install a bittorrent client (try http://download.utorrent.com/1.7.7/utorrent.exe) then use a torrent Search site like www.isohunt.com. Download the torrent then sit and relax.

To know more about bittorent concept check wipidia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_(protocol)

Hope this is helpful.

My old boss even had to drive back (in an Isuzu Trooper, mind you) from deep within the inland sea only on 2WD because the gear-box malfunctioned.

We have no idea what the inland sea would be like - hence the questions, lol - so anyway we decided to take the in laws to the singing sand dunes - a bit of a mission to find them (as all the directions I have found on the web are sketchy at best!!!)  but we got there in the end and they sang for us!!!! :-)

We shall do the inland sea when more of us can go!

Qatar Living ads dont look as good as before..


My husband got a Prado for 100,000 QAR with just 3000 kms driven..I see the same price on cars having driven more than 50,000 kms.


Are there any other ways to find a good, second hand car?

Just keep on trying you will find genuine sellers who may offer cars at reasonable price. Some people are just using the Classifieds to make money by buying and selling cars. Avoid such adverts and people.

			<RelCBody>I must confess that I made a small profit on one of previous cars.

I bought a Land Rover Discovery model 2003 back in 2009 for around QR42k which was advertised for QR48k 10 months later I advertised it for QR45 and I got QR43k for it.

So Rizks is right, you have to negotiate. Only pay the price what you think is right. Your husband got a bargain but those kind of bargains don't happen too often on Qatar living, so don't be disappointed and keep looking..:)</RelCBody>

And also I think, she had some certain answers ready, and she just tried to apply one of them to this question, which was absolutely not applicable.

			<RelCBody>can u find her mobile number?
then the chip is registered at Qtel
that will have her id
that will have her sponsorship details

however this info is confidential and you may need a higher authority to intervene

there may be a really good reason why she doesn't want to be contactable by her mother.  one would assume she would have kept up contact if she so wished.

maybe ask her mother to seek advice from nearest Qatar embassy.</RelCBody>

I know of someone that had this happen to her a few years back. She didnt have any issue when she went to a private doctor rather than a private hospital.


Even if she is not miscarrying how does she propose to pull this off when it is time for the baby to arrive? She will have to leave Qatar before she starts to show anyway.

			<RelCBody>Here's the content of the thread;

You are probably all aware by now that there are new dress regulations in place in Qatar - the 4 and 5 star hotels were given 10 days to comply with the new rules which are that you must be &amp;quot;appropriately dressed&amp;quot; - no explanation of what this is but it seems to be no knees (even at night in nightclubs etc) and no shoulders. I've heard of people being refused entry to restaurants for having slits up their dresses and (in the case of a 14 year old) showing their knees. I've been told the shopping centres are also now turning people away for wearing halter necks etc (Landmark in particular).

One friend just rang me to say that a group of her girlfriends were stopped from going into W last weekend - each of them had something &amp;quot;inappropriate&amp;quot; from cleavage, to knees to shoulders. You also have to now show either your ID card or passport for entry into bars and (the scary part) if you aren't dressed appropriately they take your ID card and scan it and send it to CID (apparently this is what happened to my friends friends last weekend).</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>I'm all for clamping down on inappropriate clothing in the shopping malls and in public, but I think there should be more leeway when it comes to the hotels.

Also, they should have started implementing these rules a decade ago. They've let things go to far to have a hope in hell of policing it properly.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>What a joke - the clubs and bars were about the only place a girl could look nice and not worry about shoulders, knees and cleavage showing.

No offence but anyone who could potentially be offended by short skirts or low cut tops shouldn't be in the clubs anyway.

Is Qatar turning into Saudi? Qatar will never get any tourism with stupid rules like this.

My boyfriend lives in Bahrain however and I visit him there every weekend.  Bahrain is a lot more laid back, you can buy pork, get a glass of wine and a restaurant and access anything you want on the internet.  It doesn't have all the oil money so the locals are a little more down to earth but it's more developed.  Better restaurants and shopping malls.

			<RelCBody>Well I date a Saudi so I have to say he and his friends treat me very respectfully. Yes lot's of them do go to Bahrain on the weekends, but so do a lot of Qataris and Kuwatis.  The place is basically crawling with people from the more conservative nations on the weekend.  Besides the fact that the number of land cruisers increases and there are more people in the pubs I haven't noticed a difference.


As for dress, I can dress less conservatively in Bahrain than here.  There are more single women as well so I don't feel like I stand out so much.  Bahrani girls don't wear the abaya as much as here and I haven't seen to many in hijab.  I doubt she'll notice many stares at all. 


As for it becoming more conservative, well they are closing down all the bars in the 3 star hotels because that's where all the prosititutes hang out.  But my guess is you won't even notice they are gone. </RelCBody>

There are more single women as well so I don't feel like I stand out so much. Bahrani girls don't wear the abaya as much as here and I haven't seen to many in hijab. I doubt she'll notice many stares at all. As for it becoming more conservative; well they are closing down all the bars in the 3 star hotels because that's where all the prosititutes hang out. But my guess is you won't even notice they are gone.</RelCClean>

			<RelCBody>i personally hate the blackberry, it is a pain in the arse to use. The iphone i pretty over rated in my opinion, yeah it's a tidy piece of kit got some cool things, but it is stupidly expensive here, IF i ever get one i will wait till Vodaphone release them (and they will).

got to agree with shyampsunder on this one, go with HTC, they have being doing the touch systems for alot of brands of phone for a long time, and now they have their own phone, their features are great, and they are very easy to use. Wish i had one.

I use a n95 been using it for over a year now, and it does everything i need it to.

Love isn't something definite and noone can tell u what it is, u can only feel it, and u feel it differently towards different people, I mean u love ur friend in a different way than ur fiancee for example.

			<RelCBody>lol apple, ur not a liar because u didn't define love, yeah it's that wonderful feeling but can u say what feeling it is ? u can't.

I mean people spend years trying to write books about love and relationships but it's all nonsense because no relationship is like another, every relationship has its own dynamic and each love is unique so none of us can define love, we recognize it when we feel it but we can't define it because each one of us feels it differently.


I'm doing good, taking my daily dose of QL hehe, what about u ?</RelCBody>

As I said dont even think about it. You have no right I think to marry a qatari actually if you are muslim and girl is muslim then no law in the world should stop you from marrying if done in proper way but sorry brother this is not the place.

			<RelCBody>Dont listen to their nonsense. If you want to marry a Qatari girl, you will first of all need her families approval. After that - you may apply for an approval from higher authorities. The husband isn't, under any circumstance, going to get the Qatari passport if this is accepted and approved. The children will hold the father nationality - and they will not benefit any of the privileges that locals have.

Good luck and let me know if you need more information.</RelCBody>

2) If you need to apply for Family Visit Visa, you need to have NOC from your Company, Bank Statement ( For Me to Sponsor my Brother, Didn't Required Bank Statement ), Salary Certificate, But 1st you need to Obtain your RP.


3) Make Sure to Clarify with your Company if they are Giving you Family Status Visa or Not, and Minimum Salary to Sponsor your Wife and Kids on Visit Visa is 7000 QAR Basic, and to Apply for their Resident Permit Basic Salary should be 10,000 QAR.

I just found out today I cannot exchange my American driver's license for a Qatari one.

I am not looking to pay for training courses, I want to go directly into the test.

Thanks.</RelQBody>

			<RelCBody>Am not sure about exchanging the licence but for the test first of all there is no parallel parking test
You can go to RAYA driving school and go the police officer first with the form and all required documents and try to exchange your license if not he will sign the form for you to do the test directly.
You should do this first because the school will till that you need to take 10 lessons course



You will start at 5:30 with the theoretical (signs exam) they will ask not more than 5-6 signs if you answered with confidence and quickly.
THE DRIVING SCHOOL HAVE A SMALL BOOKLET that has around 30 signs


Then they will let you know if you pass if yes you go out to start the practical exam:
1)	Is the hill test , you have to stop in the middle (on the line painted in the street) then continue till the end of it, then reverse back to you starting point , which means you have to reverse as L shape
2)	Then you go to the parking test, you have to do it in one shot and make sure not to cross the lines or hit the, and you have to reverse back from the parking position.
3)	After a while they will let you know if you pass and if yes they will call your name so you in the bus and start follow the test car.
4)	When you fell that you are ready and you want to go next and when the bus stops go out and go to the car and start with the seat belt  then the mirror and start driving smoothly as you used to do, dont think of it as an exam.
You can search in qatarliving and you will find many answers
GOOD LUCK

No really, if you're going to DC, then you're better off taking the QR flight coz we fly there non-stop and the aircraft is the A340-600 which is a beauty to fly in, especially if you're flying the premium class... even if it is economy, the pitch in between the seats is so much better than EK.
If you're flying to NY, then i think EK go there direct, coz we fly to Newark (EWR) viz Geneva, on the A330, which is also a good aircraft to fly in...
Hell yeh, all QR aircrafts are good to fly in you know why... &amp;quot;Coz we take you more personally&amp;quot;... (and i'm saying that with a straight face)...

I was like yeah fine, but is that what you will keep saying to rest of 9 families standing here with me!!?? LOL

Contrastingly, and I am being very true here, I haven't faced a single problem with Qatar Airways flights for as long as I could remember. Last I can remember having a problem on QR was perhaps with food or something 3 years back.

One a much important note, I haven't had any luck with any EK crew yet, sadly! :(

Regd you Jakarta trip, i think we fly the A300 aircraft there and those aircraft's are being converted into freighters, coz they are kinda old.
LHR-DOH...cancelled... why? I'm sure there was a reason for that and you would have been compensated (not that it is any consolation)
And AMM trip... well delays were a part of the airport expansion during that time...

So dun you think i deserve a good BONUS this year... (if they have heard of anything like that)...lol!!!

RAY - Let's not talk bout the wifey... she used to fly with QR competitors at one point in time and when I joined QR, I asked her to come and fly with us. She simply refused and was like... are you nuts? I am so happy here, why wud i wanna ruin that...

			<RelCBody>Yeh I flew Joberg from Dubai like 2 years ago when we were starting there and i was upgraded to Businesss Class. But i can really tell you that QR Economy class service on these long haul flights was better than the EK J class service. Besides, they always mishandle baggage coz they have a minimum connecting time of i think 1.5 hours, so if your connecting anytime less than that, youu can rest assured, your baggage won't ride the flight you're in. So not the case with QR.

Kinda happens in most places, the handling company will always refer you to the airline...

He should be allowed to leave and travel outside the country, but if there is a court appointment during his/her absence and failed to attend, that would be a lost point for your friend and a credit to the theft.


Possibility is, without the complainant or witness during court sessions, the Judge might cancel the case and drop down your friend's complains:(((

			<RelCBody>Small correction here, Eng &amp;amp; Avid;)

Your company can issue you an exit permit, but you will still be blocked by the Immigration at the airport during departure, when your name is blacklisted in the system.


If you know that you had previous police case( ex. returned cheque), obtaining exit permit doesn't mean that your name is cleared from the system. You must follow up w/ the capital police after 6-months from the date you settled your case to remove the blacklisted of your name in the Immigration airport.

			<RelCBody>You got good points, and neither i'm not arguing w/ you. I was giving you an example of a police case(ex. returned cheques). Coz this is the common case that can happen to anyone.

If your case was filed at Capital Police, you need to clear your name from there. If it was a Court case then you should go to Niyaba. Mostly, the case are to be filed from the Police dept. then forwarded to the court for settlement depends on both the plaintiff &amp;amp; the suspects agreement.

Another example is if your bank filed a complaints against you to the capital police for not paying your debts(Car loan, Credit cards, Personal loans), then your name will be blacklist in the system till you settled your accounts. Accordingly, only after 6-months from the date of your settlement before your name is remove from the blacklist.

What i'm trying to imply here is, if you know that you had previous but settled criminal or civil cases, nothing wrong to clear your name &amp;amp; follow up at the place where the charges against you were filed. This is to get assurance that you wont face any hassles in the airport Immigration during departure.

Because....based on a friend experienced. She had a court case wherein the Baladiya filed against her for hanging clothes in the Veranda of her flat. It was located in the main road of Mughalina. She was fined QR500/ and manage to closed the case. But when she was supposed to leave emergency (her sister was serious), the Immigration Airport stopped her from leaving. Even if she told them &amp;quot;i dont have any pending case and my sister is dying!&amp;quot;, still they dont listen for her as her name was blacklist in the system. Since it was Thursday evening, she needs to wait for 2 days till Sunday to go &amp;amp; clear her name from the system. In short, her sister died while she was still in Doha. She could have talked to her in her last moment:((((

I just wish it will never happen again to anyone among us!</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>go to the sales center in the arrivals terminal &amp;amp; talk to the sales staff there.

almaha only takes bookings prior to 24 hours of the flights, how ever depending on the work load they have a chance of accepting your booking, yet you might have to pay a sum of Qr 300.00 extra to the normal service fee.

i too agree with Khanan. she will be able to proceed her self if you are able of instructing her on how to. make sure you give her clear instructions. if she is a bit old, ask her to hire a porter for just Qr 20.00(porter counter is located to the left once you enter the baggage area. it will give you a porter ticket enabling her to hire a porter) which, the porter will locate the bag for her &amp;amp; bring her to you. if you wish to you can tip the porter with another additional amount of your choice.

i dont see any point of u wasting about 500-600qr when you can get the work done just in 20qr - 30qr.

all the best &amp;amp; wish your mom a pleasant stay in DOH!

one should only fear only if they have issues with their visa.


regardless of what visa type a passenger hold.

ask your mom to keep her passport, ticket copy (if available) &amp;amp; visa copy ready before she proceed to the immigration area/counter. instruct her on where exactly you live in DOH as the immigration staff may require these information.

i personally know people who clear by them selves before almaha does.

i bet she can clear by her self. dont waste your money, give your mom some quality time with that money which you are planing to spend on this service which you are looking at.

Corniche have these mini playground for kids.
Katara is nice for sightseeing.
You can  BBQ at the beach but its a bit far from AlSadd though.
Aspire park have a running path/track where you can jog.

			<RelCBody>Well, I remember this happening around my place last year &amp;amp; my dad had to literally go out and shout at them.


U can just get the supervisor's contact number from those workers and speak to him regarding this. They are actually not permitted to work in residential areas at odd hours (23.00hrs - 5.00hrs). Just speak to him and tell him its not tolerable since u have school going kids at home and if it continues then u would complain to the higher authorities.

Its too complicated to discuss, but good luck.

I did not point fingers at anyone - so I don't think you should be sensitive about anything that I say.

In Arabic we say, ilKhair yikhis - ou ilShar yi'2im, which means ((the good is of one, the bad is generalized)). I hope that is understood.

			<RelCBody>Great photoshop Edifis and appropriate theme. LOL

Dating sites all seem to be controlled by the same holding group, just the web addresses are different, the page layout, photographs etc are the same. Just by the accessing person's IP address they change the country in the advertisement, so as to attract a click. It all ends up the same &amp;quot;Pay by Creditcard/Paypal/Money Transfer&amp;quot;.

My hypothesis is that, there are actually two worlds while we males dwell in one, lots and lots of beautiful girls seem to be spending time in loneliness in some other world, somewhere out there. My plan is just to stay alive till the time the two worlds meet !!! </RelCBody>

On Saturday while waiting on line to buy cakes, a student asked her what should be done concerning Paquistan, that protects terrorists (this aren't my words but what the student said to her). Than asked if they (the U.S.) should cross the border to Pakistan. She replied to him that's exactly what they should do, in the debate between Obama and McCain, that was Obama's position while McCain was against it.

In Islam man candivroce and women has also (but mostly twisted cultural crap take over the islamic values), but to safegaurd the process there is some time period for reconcialiation between the couple.

Therefore my question is why in other parts of the world they cant?? Are they just simply ignorant; arrogant or are they having any hidden agendas? The reason to raise this is to ""educate"" the world of the true meaning of peaceful living. Your comments please!!"</RelQClean>

			<RelCBody>I do not know what styles are available, however the stand alone ones that look like old radiators are sealed steam heaters and you can also buy the small electric heaters in which you can physically see the coils and they blow air via a fan across the coils.

Personally you should just have a warm body to curl up with.  If it is too cold for one get a second and snuggle up.  Skin on skin is the best way to stay warm and transfer body heat.

			<RelCBody>Just buy a new replacement plug and repair the existing cord.  Next step is to make sure the outlet is installed properly and then verify the rating on the breaker.  Don't trust the wiring in the house until you pull the wall plate and check the wire size and termination.  Not the best electrical work is being done in the new construction, always verify.

			<RelCBody>Hi Tanuzahir, i think nachu  is right, you can find better job if you are masters degree holder... anyway, in place like Doha International Kindergartens the salary would be in range between 25k- 35k with list of allowances (depending if you are going to be sponsored by them or not) http://www.dohaacademy.net/home/dik

			<RelCBody>You are exactly in the same situation where my wife was. She is doctorate and was teaching in college. After my daughter born, she resigned. When my daughter reached to 4 years of age, she took the job in the same school where my daughter got admission. She worked for almost free just to be with my daugher all the time. Her sacrifices paid and now my daughter works for Microsoft USA.
Any way, very nice to know about your outstanding education and achievments
Do not bother for the salary. How much is enough is enough, no one can define.

Have a Master Degree too. After I had children, I left my well paid job. Many of my friends said I was stupid. There were times I even asked myself if I was doing the right thing? Was I wasting my education?


Now I am back to work, but not in a challenging position like before. I focused on mainly timings so I could be with my family.


Thankyou so much so sharing your story. It's nice to have these little reminders of what is worthwhile. </RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Ice Maiden, That's so similar to my story. Its been a year for me as a stay home mommy and this will be same for next 6 months and then we will leave Qatar so that I can continue working. I stayed home for all this time here just so that we could stay together as a family while hubby completes his assignments here. Have questioned my decision myself quite a lot of time but I am happy and so is my family. So that's all that matters in the end :-)

Sorry for the little hijack. </RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>a decent Nursery over here that keeps your kid until 3pm. It is not like England over here.

Avoid in house food too. Too many 'support staff' from third world countries that don't wash their hands.


Only go with British run ones and then I would check out the number of 'cheap labor' staff they had.

Look at is this way, if you were paying a lot of money for a supposed decent Nursery, you would expect the staff to be trained. Over here we don't have that.


Most of them have 'degrees' from a Mickey Mouse University. They say they have degrees in Nursing, Education and Admin. Most can't speak English.

Really do your research, it is crap over here with the number of third world people who say they have degrees and then don't even know what they are supposed to be talking about.

They are desperate for jobs and will lie to get one. They don't care at all that your kids education may be hindered by them lying.

Just be careful.

At the moment i dont think i see the teachers full force, i only see the one who works during summer school. I dont even have an idea that they are only works for the summer or the actual teachers for the school.

All i can say the nursery have very good reputation around Doha.

			<RelCBody>30QR per hour seems to be the standard charge for private arrangements for house cleaning here in Doha plus you might have to pay a transportation charge too depending where she/he is coming from - hopefully you will find someone local in Al Khor!

Most cleaners here are either Philipino's, Sri Lankans or Indonesians. I have a Philli lady and she is very thorough. Speaking English reasonably well also helps!
Why would you want someone 6 hrs a day 3 times a wk? Unless you also want someone for child minding. My cleaning lady does top and bottom of our 3 bed villa in 3 hours and does a good job. She comes twice a week mostly to get rid of the dust that continually seeps in from all cracks n crevices! LOL
We do outsource ironing though and I do our washing! If you can find a good laundry service in Al Khor it should be quite cheap and satisfactory! Ours pick up and deliver too.
Good luck in your search and hope this helps!</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Hi Banker,

You didn't mention the budget :)

Anyway, to get a nice 3BD apartment then try not to get less than 8,500QR accomodation allowence.

If you are looking for a villa then ask for 13,000QR.

			<RelCBody>just commenting how exspensive the accomodation in Doha at the moment. 4 yrs ago when we just arrived, beverly hills was 6500 QR, and we thought that was exspensive.


Safwany ... i guess u know how much Beverly Hills cost now. My son school is in DESS, so i guess when i move i need to move somewhere around that area. At the moment i am commuting in the traffic daily from Muntaza traffic light to the school.


Got alot of girlfriend who looking around for a house. Everytime they call for the agent they will asked where your hubby working for? Bachtel, Maersk, Halliburton or something like that. Then they know how much your allowance would be. If your hubby working in small company, they dont bother to respond to your query.

			<RelCBody>Hi Novita77,

I don't know exactly how much it is the beverly hills but I think it wont be less than 13,000.

Some agents are worse than the greedy landlords, it is better not to tell them where their hubbys work so they can get a response, or you can tell them to contact me if you want :)

By the way, I may have something very nice in this area but it is not cheap, what is your budget ?

			<RelCBody>You can get an apartment for around 6,000 Riyals (2-bedroom) in a reasonably good area, a car can be hired for 1,800 to 2,000 Riyals a month (or buy one as you won't have a problem to get finance for buying) and the rest is up to you, how much you spend on food. You can go to 5 star restaurants and pay 300 Riyals for a meal or go to the shwarma shops and other more simple restaurants and pay less than 30 Riyals.

There is choice for every taste/price/possibilities.

Villa living is between 10 -14 000QR/month for something nice, and apartment living is between 6500 -8500QR/month for a 2-3 bedroom.  So what you will be saving will depend on how you are living. Good luck!</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Some of the apartments you can buy at the Pearl they will let you change a bit of the floorplan that is what we did with a 3 bedroom took away the maids quarters. Most of the developments are behind schedule. Prices were high to begin with but have gone even higher. Say a 3 bedroom for 1.4 million now its like 1.8 and up. Foreigners that buy can get a lifelong visa which is helpful if they want to work past retirement age. </RelCBody>

			<RelQSubject>Help! Talk to me about Eid...</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I know it's a ways off, but I would love to hear how people in Qatar celebrate the holiday. I imagine it's more fun here than in the U.S. for example, because Qatar is a Muslim country.

Does anyone have special traditions to commemorate the end of Ramadan? I would like to profile some responders in a magazine I write for. Let me know asap! Thanks :)</RelQBody>

			<RelCBody>I remember my Eid childhood. It was great.
We'd first meet up at my grandfather's home. We'd all talk and the children would plan 3ayuding.

We'd all go from house to house, sing a song and look cute and be given 1 riyal.


After going door to door, we'd go back home and play until it was time to eat the large feast.

Parents would usually chat.

Families get together.
People visit and they have some tea and snacks.

We pray.

I love Eid!

			<RelCBody>Oh Oryx,  you are so right!  Ramadan should be a month of less (material things) and more (spirituality).  For a lot it is.  Our schedules do not change much (eg. we do not eat all night which negates the point of fasting in my opinion).

We break our fast at sunset with a small light meal.  Then we have dinner in the evening. We get up before dawn for a small breakfast. We try to be better Muslims in this month...in the hope we can carry this on throughout the year.

I do see Qatar changing from when I was a child during Ramadan.  This is something to do with us, of course, and also the influx of expats.

			<RelCBody>We tend to do a bit of baking prior to Eid.
Usually the night before (or earlier if you're really organised) we gather the kids around and make some biscuits and traditional sweets. These are then ready to distribute during the Eid prayer and also to the neighbours. They are also really handy when people come to visit you during Eid.
What I've noticed here in Qatar is that friends and neighbours seem to visit each other a lot more on Eid than back home. I guess it's because we don't have family here, so our friends tend to become our new support structure.
On the 2 Eids that I've so far spent in Qatar our 'new' tradition seems to be going to City Centre and getting some good sale items! LOL I guess that's our variation on spending the day at the park (too hot) or visiting the grandparents (too far) or staying at home (too boring).

As the article in the Gulf-times on Saturday mentioned,we have at the moment over 40 dogs devided in 14 kennels &amp;amp; 8 Isolation-kennels....
It`s really the matter of lack of space.....

Anyway, welcome back again Cornellian, we missed you here and the strange thing is that you did not show up all the time you were on vacation. Did you went to an isolated island where there is not Internet at all? :)

			<RelCBody>My husband just went to the QDC yesterday but the bill seems to have vanished.  Anyway, the cost is reasonable.  The beer usually comes in cases of 24 and there is a good selection. I have heard of people making requests for specific things when they can't find them on the shelf and they have brought these in. They limit the amount you can spend to 10% of your salary.

			<RelCBody>Here are the list which i found here in QL i just made copy and paste ^_^ LOL:


Bars in Doha (Starting from Rugby Club moving to Marriott)including drink prices; average nationality of customer, musical tastes and % of prostitutes.

Rugby Club: Similar to Garveys only maybe 60% British, not as many rig pigs and a lot more 16 year olds. Sometimes a DJ plays. Never seen any pros there either. Nearly impossible to get into now if you dont have a membership. Average drink price: 15QR

Ramada:
Orion: Located on the top of the new Ramada Plaza, it's 80% male, mostly Indian/Arab. I've never noticed the music but I think there's a Filipino band some nights. Average drink price: 30 QR

Manhatten: Tiny little bar also located in Ramada Plaza. 99% Qatari men. Average drink price: 40 QR

Bubbles: 50% men/50% women usually in couples with a good line of Qatari's holding up the bar. Serves champagne/cocktails and has a singer and piano player that play too loudly. Average drink price: 50QR

Sherazad: The sports bar in the old Ramada. 70% men, Indian/Arab/Western. 30% Prostitute. Average drink price: 20 - 30QR

Qube: Nightclub. 78% men, Filipino/Western; all women are upstairs in VIP area that you need a woman to get up to. 99% women on the main floor are prostitutes. Music is DJ/Hip Hop/House. Joe Mitri is actually pretty good if you really want to dance on a Thursday night. Average drink price: 30 - 50 QR

La Cigale:
Madisson Piano Bar: 50% men, 50% women (couples), 100% Lebanese. Lebanese singer, playing romantic songs, serves expensive cocktails. Need to book a reservation 2 weeks in advance to go on a Thursday. Average drink price: 50 - 60QR

Sky View: 50% men, 50% women (couples); 98% Lebanese and 2% every other nationality that tries to get a reservation and are usually treated like poo. Chilled music, expensive drinks. Average drink price: 50- 60 QR

Mecure Hotel
Old Manor
50% Qatari and other westerners. Good food (Steak and kidney pie, good steaks)big soft louge chairs, crap guy playing the keyboards. Drinks around 30 QR

1st floor bar. Never been been but understand 100% pro all the time. No idea on prices. No idea on clientele either.

Merweb
Cloud Nyn: 100% chav of all nationalities, can't stand the awful strobe light, and as for the price of drinks, who knows cause I have a migraine and have to leave after 5 minutes.

Golf Club
Spikes Lounge: Relatively cheap drinks made better by the avaliablity of pitchers! Also has really decent pub food such as chicken wings and nachos. You can sit outside and look over the Golf course and feel like you aren't in Doha. Nationalities range, however mostly Western/Japanese/Korean (your avid golf lovers) 85% male, 24.5% female, and you can occasionally find prostitutes. Average drink: 30 QR

Ritz Carlton:
Habanos: Small cigar bar, salsa music, 50% men/50% women (couples) drinks are a bit pricey, but good atmosphere. Average drink price: 60 QR

Admirals: night club. Plays Arabic music. 90% men, Arab; 10% females Arab Nice outdoor area. Drinks: pricey and nearly impossible to get the bartenders attention. Average drink price: 50 QR (they have revamped, I havent been yet, so I dont know but I hear its gone kind of more pubish then night club).

La Mer Wine Bar: Expensive drinks, though excellent view of the city. This place is posher then posh. Average Drink price: the cheapest glass of wine starts at 70 QR. No more pros to be seen cause they cant afford the wine. ;)

Intercontinental:
Palomas: Tex-Mex/Salsa bar. DJ Sam play Thursday and Friday nights. 65% men Western/Arab, 25% female Western/Filipina/Arab and QA stews, 10% prostitute. Average drink price 30 - 45 QR

Irish Harp: Folk music, drink prices are average, usually packed. 60% men, all nationalities; 40% female. Average drink price: 40 QR Never noticed pros there BECAUSE:::

Waterhole: 60% men all nationalities, 40% prostitute (if not more on a given night) Music and drink price: Christ only knows cause I've never stayed long enough to find out.

Gulf Horizon Hotel: Located in the souk next to the Rawnaq and above a juice stall, the 8th floor of the Gulf Horizon boasts a bar. Not much to be said for this place except the drinks are CHEAP!!! 12 QR a shot, 12 QR a bottled beer (tickets must be purchased to get alcohol) and it's 100% men, all Indian, Nepali and a few Filipino's. I had my ass grabbed and was hooted at no fewer then 20 times and basically feared for my life. We left without finishing one drink.

W

Crystal Lounge: Havent been yet ( I know SHOCKING) but it serves Crystal champagne and its supposed to be all black. Drink prices start at around 40 QR to 50 QR

Wahm Sheisha Terrace: the only Sheisha terrace in Doha that serves alcohol.

Dunes: Cigar barno idea of price yet.

			<RelCBody>Drink with the locals? This is an Islamic country, the locals don't drink.
There are no longer any bars except the Rugby Club that are not attached to Hotels as far as I know. You have to show your ID card to get into lisenced premises here so not sure how it will work with a visitor visa.
It is definitely illegal not only to import alcohol but also consume alcohol in any public place and also be drunk in public.

			<RelCBody>Tsardoz - Talking about flavoursome beers, you can buy Franziskaner wheat beer here. Nowehere as good as Schoffer Hoffer but a good compromise considering you're in an almost dry nation.

So if you're a SH fan like me, drink your fill before you come over. I remember that terrible desperation when Dan Murphy's stopped stocking this beer in Melbourne. After a brief search I found it at Vintage Liquors (Coles).

You can get your share of euro lagers as mentioned by previous posters.

As a true blue Aussie, I'm sure you'd understand if I said I can piss better than a Bud and won't touch Fosters with a stick.

VB, Guinness and Kilkenny can be found here too. Sadly no XXXX or Carlton Cold.

If you're feeling adventurous or want to slum it, try Kingfisher Strong. As an Indian I'd also recommend the regular Kingfisher (American style macro lager). Not similar to the one that can be purchased in Oz. That's made in New Zealand under license.

			<RelQBody>Hi,
am employed in a firm in Qatar since three months now. Since I have no friends here, i would like someone to help me know how and where to buy some alcohol.

I hate to go to bars or hotels where they charge you so much that the spirits dont seem to help you enjoy the mood.

Anyone who helps me is welcome for a good time anytime.

BTW, do we need permits to drink at a bar in Qatar??

thanks,
Zakir.</RelQBody>

			<RelCBody>My parents started giving us beer when we were about 14.  We had whiskey when were about the same age, but for a teenager it isn't really that nice.

In summer it was gin and tonics, and wine too.

We didn't have vodka in the house, but it's good for teens because you can mix it with juices and soft drinks.

In my opinion consuming the infrequent alcoholic beverage is a much better option than giving your kids soft drinks, chips, chocolate, sweet snacks, candy and burgers on a daily basis.

Obesity and its related illnesses pose a much bigger threat to public health than alcohol abuse.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>I've been so stressed over my dog being sick that I've lost 5 pounds in 5 days...

Yep counting calories and exercise works, but...what you ladies have to remember is that men lose weight faster and easier than women do. Its the estrogen in our bodies that fight the weight loss. God made it so that we would always have that extra reserve in case there was a time of starvation or deprivation, so that we could maintain our bodies to have babies...

If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man.

# Avoid eating between meals. Instead drink hot water, or if necessary eat ripe sweet fruit.

# Avoid reheated or stale food.

# Most of one's food should be cooked, as the body can more easily absorb cooked food. Raw food should be eaten only as a side dish (e. g. salad).

# Make use of culinary spices. They not only make the food tasty, but support the digestive processes as well.

# Include all 6 tastes in each meal: sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and astringent. The tastes also have their own influence on the subtle inner balance of the physiology.

# During meals you may sip liquids such as water, juice or lassi. Do not drink a lot and avoid ice-cold drinks - they dampen down the digestive processes.

# Milk should not be drunk with the main meal. It can be taken alone or with a light meal of sweet tasting foods (e.g. toast, cereals etc). Minimise food of other tastes.

# Honey should not be heated above body temperature (40 degrees C) and therefore should not be used in cooking or baking.

There is also an exhaustive list on the combination of food which is good and bad.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Carbohydrate rich food is not combined with acidic food items. eg if you take bread and lemon juice together, it will cause the digestive system to erratically digest both the items.


Don't eat grain, cereal or pulses item with acidic items like citrus fruits, grapes, pineapple etc.

Protein rich food items go well with low-carb food items like rice and vegetable. Vegetables also go well with all types of starchy, carbohydrate rich food items.

Fruits should ideally be taken as a separate meal, independent of other regular meals.

Milk and meat is bad combination.

Never take milk and meat in a single meal. Separate intake of milk and meat by at least four hours. Milk and meat is good for body in several ways. When taken together, it becomes toxic.


Many modern food styles fly on the face of this Ayurvedic food combination rule.

Milk is also to be taken warm. Cold milk can cause indigestion. Taking milk too hot also is not desirable.

Ending the meals with sweet dessert is not allowed in Ayurveda.


One needs to end a full-belly meal with some hot and light item like buttermilk. Buttermilk is curd diluted with water and added with a pinch of salt, chilly powder, some curry leaves and a bit of ginger. Many times ginger and curry leaves are avoided from the combination, only due to difficulty in availability.

Other factor to keep in mind with Ayurvedic food combination includes the endurance of the digestive system. A strong digestive fire (pitta) almost over-rides some of the effects associated with unscientific food combination. Not all are blessed with such a strong digestive fire.

And the most important food rule by Ayurveda
Don't burden your digestive system by eating too full. Over-eating is already a strict no-no, Ayurveda suggests you take half-stomach solid food, fill a quarter with water and leave the rest free. This is best for proper digestion.

			<RelCBody>Thanks aaid. I plan to go to Salam one evening so I'll let you know what I find if I go before you. From reading up online I'm veering towards the IXUS 860 because of its wide angle lens. 8mp is more than enough for my needs so I don't think it's worth paying the extra for the 12mp 960 which doesn't have the wide angle lens (they seem to be the only differences)

thatguy - Thanks. I do plan to buy online but I wanted to try out the various models before I ordered. Carrefour only have a couple of Canon compact cameras, none of them IXUS (and they appeared to have stop stocking Canon SLRs and lenses for some reason), and the Kodak shops have a very poor selection of manufacturers.

			<RelCBody>cannon has for years proved they are better than any other camera manufacturer by far.

with both there dslr and there point and shoot cameras... the cannon power shot and the cannon rebel xrti plus the cannon 40 and 20 d plus the 1d and 5d cameras are the best and top rated cameras over and over and over again...

sony does make a good cyber shot camera but even then name of the camera shows that it is trying to immulate the power shot...

cyber shot

power shot

this has been noted ever since the first power shot was revieled... sony made the cyber shot in hopes that people would by the cyber shot in mistake of the name...

plus if you dont take my word for it... go here and look at all the reviews for different cameras

http://www.dpreview.com/

plus you will see that cannon is more for quality and sony is more for the compactness of a camera...

			<RelCBody>It is really complicated..Palestine is probably the most prominent indicator of how unjust the world is being lead by politics and power. To your point, I would say it is due to the evolution of the political scene and the behaviour of the Zionist regime which  pushed it into isolation to the point where they could not get adequate votes among UN member states. Additionally, west is a bit tired of supporting the Zionist's states and cleaning up its miss so they want to have some stability..The west was a key player in creating the Zionist state but they did not have the same intention Zionist's had..My thought anyway..interesting topic :)</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Why nearly all countries agreed was quite simple. Most believe in a homeland for the Palestinian people but not all can agree on what that should actually be. So making Palestine an observe state is a statement of intent without backing a full independence.

Israel while continuing to build settlements in the West Bank is undermining the whole process and it seems obvious they want to swallow all Palestinian terrority. Shame on them.</RelCBody>

for some crying is not abt weakness or wanting the other person to say sorry or give in to the situation but instead for me when i do cry/shed my tears is because i am so angry/upset that i want to say things that i am sure is gonna hurt the other person (saying out of anger) but i am trying so hard to control it as once it comes out there is no way of taking it back so to speak. so i am controlling it so hard that instead tears come flowing down, most ppl in an angry state will say things (hurtful things) in the moment of anger and when all has subsided realize that and its too late as itis already said and done with and hence hurts theother person........
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
my mom once told me the tooth paste story- only take the amt thatyou need ifyou were to squeeze too much of out the tube ya cant put it back in =-same goes for things said when in the heat of the moment (does morehurt than good)

you cant take back whatever you have spitted, so better shed tears than spit a mouthful of words brought by hurt or anger that you can never take back when you calm down

later on, you can both decide which religion to follow.

There can be several causes.  If overheating, you will have a more whitish smoke mixed with steam.  Do not just put water in the reservoir...you will need to use anti-freeze, but you will also need to have your thermostat checked out.

If its greyish/blackish smoke, you're burning oil and you most likely have a broken head gasket or valve...both of these conditions are indicative of the worst case scenario.

Also, don't forget to check your tire pressure every time you refuel.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>QL will lose it's basic purpose I guess.

In About QL they mention

&amp;quot;Participation is at the heart of our web site. We believe that collectively our members have more knowledge about life in Qatar than any one person or guidebook. We want to provide a platform for them to share their knowledge and experiences and help newcomers adapt easily to life in Qatar.&amp;quot;

Nobody shares knowledge or experiences or tries to help others in a chat room, it will just become a place for guys trying to pick up girls. There will not be any participation from all the members on any issue, people will be too busy chatting in private.

 That's what I personally think anyway.

			<RelCBody>Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there.to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson or help figure out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be but you lock eyes with them, you know that very moment that they will affect your life in some profound way.



And sometimes things happen to you at the time that may seem horrible, painful and unfair, but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would never realize your potential, strength, will power or heart.




Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of luck. Illness, love, lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test limits of your soul.



Without these small tests, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless.




The people you meet affect your life. The successes and downfalls that you experience can create whom you are, and the bad experiences can be learned from. In fact they are probably the most poignant and important ones. If someone hurts you, betrays you or breaks your heart, forgive them because they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious to whom you open your heart.



If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but also because they are teaching you to love and open your heart and eyes to little things. Make every day count. Appreciate everything that you possibly can, for you may never experience it again.



Talk to people whom you have never talked to before, and actually listen. Let yourself fall in love, break free and set your sights high. Hold you head up because you have every right to.



Tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself, for if you don't believe in yourself, no one else will believe in you. Create you own life and then go out and live it.

			<RelCBody>Yeah, Shanky is correct. Just go to any of the PHCs. Carry a copy of ur id card, Electricity or telephone bill for the latest month and two photographs. Give it to the Lady on the counter together with the charge QR 100 for one year. She will issue one reciept and u can get ur card exactly after one month from the same counter. Don't go by weekends coz it will be rushy.

It will be easier for u to go to the nearby PHC where ur staying.

			<RelCBody>I have just had mine done last week. You need to go to your local clinic(one with green lollipops). Mornings only, go as early as possible, take: filled in form, 2 photos, copies of RP and passport, Karama bill, 100 QR for each person.

It did not take me 5 minutes, more like 1 hour,(and 2 visits as I went in the afternoon the first time) you will be given a receipt which you can use instead of the card,the card will be issued after about 1 month.

Not a pleasant experience.</RelCBody>

			<RelQBody>Hi everyone!

Would like to have an opinion about the night clubs here in doha and which are the best? I've been to Irish Harp so far..which was good but it gets quite suffocating due to lot of smoke.

Any other recommendations?? And if at all there is a membership, How much would that be? I did not have to pay at IRISH the last time I visited :D

Thanks!

Cheers!

			<RelCBody>i went tuesday, i thaught it was pretty poor tbh, lots of working women and a bad philipino coversband playing rock ballards of the 80s.

the design is interesting, nothing like a propper nightclub, far too bright, no disco lighting, very restrictive about upstairs couples/vip area. it reminded me of nightclubs you see in american movies-pretty synthetic and fake.

i couldnt work out the booze pricing policy a Bourbon and coke cost the same price as a coke, and everyone from work had rank hangovers despite quitting at 11.30

yes its owned and staffed by ramada.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>I went on Thursday and had a good time with some friends. I thought the band was pretty good, maybe I was hypnotized by the daisy duke shorts the singers were wearing though.

Everyone that had went before me summed it up as feeling like a warehouse and it's mostly due to the white walls I think. Kinda reminded me of a high school dance in the gymnasium, buncha guys standing around leering at the girls. Hopefully after the Asian Games they will take everyone's advice and at least paint the walls and dim the lights to iimprove the atmosphere of the place.

The ratio of guys to girls was about the same as everywhere else, 10 guys to 1 girl. </RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Well if thats what you want to go to the Doha night clubs for then thats your deal.
Night life in Qatar hmmmm is there such a thing? From what I can tell they are full of Philipino women and old western men with a few other undesirables in.
Doha amongst many other cities in the world have a lot to learn about night clubs, what makes them good and what makes them bad. Predominantly what makes them bad are the clients that frequent them, in the case of Doha they will always be bad.
Face facts if you got to a nightclub to pick up women (of any culture) then your not in to clubbing!</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>To the majority of people whom have attended real clubs, go for the music, to get dressed up to impress not only others but themselves.
Many clubs are just institutions to carry on drinking after normal club closing time and to pick up members of the opposite sex.

Real clubbing....IS.... music, dancing not what has been described on here. This is not just my opinion, there are many clubbing web pages, and you will find it hard pressed to find a description of what is described on this forum.
Have you ever been to Ibiza? granted the drug scene is far to prevalent there but it is all about fun music and dancing, not about picking up women!</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>aw come on its not that bad. 


there are about 5 places which are fun to go for drinks and a dance at nighttime.  maybe 6. 


they are all quite different, one is snobby (the Pearl) one is for middle aged people and is always packed (Paloma) one has a mix of american and indian music and is really really smoky (Cloud Nyn), one is massive and has a very gay (as in kitch) cover band doing 80s stuff (Qube), one is british but i dont go there (garveys) and one is just the right size with awesome music and a good atmosphere (admirals).  </RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>I think it shouldn't be taken as just dance and drinks for nightlife.

I suffer from lackness of cultural events in Doha. As I missed Anatolian Fire, Madame Butterfly under Asian Games events, I would like to see such entertaining performances more in Doha. Much more that if we can not find any place for one , we can go for the other:D
For example, there are some nice places making wonderful fruit cocktails, why not play bowling while you drink? A big complex with bowling, billiard, electronic games for  adults strongly required...
About Alaaddin's Kingdom,it is the only theme park with nothing! It should be more inviting...with some little theatre shows, animal shows, high quality electronic video games, good food, some recreation near sea... In Turkey, they make people to sit on camels for a little tour and take photograph, sorry I couldn't see any camels since I came here(9 months).


About sea side, Doha has a wonderful corniche people just go and sit on grass, why there isn't some cafes, food courts, just something to sit and watch the scenery while you eat or drink apart from benches...

Those make the night life better and you could have somemore alternatives  other  than going to clubs. I want to think on what to do   at night, not think of which club to go!!!

I think Doha needs such places...

			<RelQSubject>Nightlife Doha vs Abu Dhabi</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi I was recently in Abu Dhabi for 4 months, I really enjoyed my time there. Although there is little to do in the blistering heat I did enjoy my weekends out and the nightlife there.


I am now in Cairo and have disliked every minute!

I have the oportunity to come to Doha and wonder what the nightlife is like there?

How does Doha compare with Abu Dhabi?

Cheers,

Jim</RelQBody>

			<RelCBody>Here's some up to date information from the Guardian that you might be interested in reading.

Al-Jazeera's troubled English language news channel is facing a &amp;quot;serious staffing crisis&amp;quot; after scores of journalists left or have not had contracts renewed amid claims of a revolt over working conditions.

Staff at the Doha-based 24-hour news channel - which only reached its first birthday in November - have told MediaGuardian.co.uk of a series of issues including the removal of benefits and a lack of pay rises which have led many to resign or look to leave.

The staff unrest comes amid speculation that al-Jazeera English is set to relaunch in the second quarter of this year with new schedules and new studios in Gaza and Nairobi.

According to insiders, resignations have occurred across the board, including the director of human resources, the director of operations, producers, senior camera operators and editors.

One source said that the general belief among staff was that the English language rolling news service &amp;quot;cost so much to set up that they are now cutting costs at the expense of quality and quantity&amp;quot;.

There are also renewed reports of tensions between al-Jazeera's Arabic language channel, which has been on air since 1996, and the more recently launched English outlet.

Sources have added that executives on the main Arabic al-Jazeera network are trying to exert more control over the English language outlet, which is mainly staffed by western journalists.

One source said the al-Jazeera editor-in-chief, Ibrahim Hilal, was pushing for the English channel to take a more Islamic slant, quoting the example of the recent furore surrounding British teacher Gillian Gibbons who was arrested in Sudan for allowing her class to name a teddy bear Muhammad.

&amp;quot;He [Hilal] sent an email banning the story from being run on al-Jazeera English because it would upset Muslims,&amp;quot; the source added. &amp;quot;It was only covered when there were riots in Sudan.&amp;quot;

Al-Jazeera is also embroiled in two employment disputes, including one in London with the former al-Jazeera English head of planning, Jo Burgin, who is claiming sex, race and religious discrimination.

Sources have said that the Washington-based former financial controller Clive Brady is also taking legal action in the US after being dismissed.

Another source described the working environment at al-Jazeera English as &amp;quot;hateful&amp;quot;.

&amp;quot;I have never worked anywhere where morale was so low,&amp;quot; one former staff member said. &amp;quot;Some people have worked very hard to produce a channel but there is no recognition whatsoever.&amp;quot;

In the employment tribunal case involving Burgin, the former staff member was given leave to continue her case alleging sex, race and religious discrimination, although her claim for unfair dismissal was dismissed after the London tribunal ruled it did not have jurisdiction.

The allegations are being contested by al-Jazeera.

MediaGuardian.co.uk put the detailed allegations to al-Jazeera's Doha-based head of media relations, Satnam Mapharu.

In a statement, he said: &amp;quot;Al-Jazeera's mission and vision has always been based on the values of human dignity, equality, and diversity.

&amp;quot;This applies not only to our coverage but also to our organisation. The commitment to diversity is the reason we have over 2,500 staff and journalists from over 40 different nationalities and from many different faiths working across all parts of the world.

&amp;quot;In a global organisation such as ours all employee grievances have a channel for resolution and we have an open door policy to resolve all issues.

&amp;quot;We assure you that any employee issues that have arisen in al-Jazeera English's short one-year history are being attended to and resolved with the dignity they deserve.

&amp;quot;Needless to say, al-Jazeera English will not negotiate contract deals with aggrieved employees neither in the media nor in the public square.&amp;quot;

More than 100 staff attended a meeting with the al-Jazeera English managing director, Nigel Parsons, on December 20 to vent their anger at which he is said to have listed a number of staff complaints including journalists who had still not received contracts since being recruited and the removal of benefits.

He is also said to have expressed his &amp;quot;frustration&amp;quot; at trying to resolve issues.

Insiders said school fees for expats were stopped a year ago because of budgetary constraints, although pressure from staff has seen them start to be re-introduced.

There is also understood to be no pension scheme or health insurance despite being in staff contracts.

Al-Jazeera English began transmitting on November 1 2006 after an 18-month delay and a last minute name change from al-Jazeera International.

Good luck to all you future employees!!

			<RelCBody>They have Karate in three styles i think Shotokan/Kyokoshin/Kempo, they also have an Aikido class, a Kickboxing class, A philipines stick fighting class, Brazilian Jui Jitsu class.

The classes are 3 times a week for an hour or if there are no classes before or after they could go longer or start earlier dependign on the instructor.


The Jui-Jitsu class is breaking for Eid holiday and will be back first thing january (like in 10 days) there will be classes 6 days a week, 3 classes will be earlier times i am not sure yet its looking like 7:30-8:30pm S/T/R and the current class which is later 10pm-11pm M/W/S , you can choose eithor or, or you can mix and match the days depending on when is best for you to attend and your schedule.


All the other instructors have younger students so they cant let go of the earlier times to my class, thats why i got stuck with the later times, for some of my students they love it because they work in Ras Laffan and only get back in doha later at night.

Cost is dealt with by the management there, i think its around 300riyals a month or you can pay per class or the longer your contract the cheaper it is, you know the more you commit to the membership the best price-per-month you will get.
I have some guys who are too busy they can only come once every two weeks or so, they pay per-class!

What year did you graduate from Doha College you seem like you were my year or the year after? I was 1996</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>I have been doing martial arts for avery long time, and it started with traditional martial arts like Karate/Taekwondo i got black belts in both and was teaching a kids class in texas when i was in university, but then with the new wave of Ultimate fighting and MMA i switched to Muay Thai kickboxing and Brazilian Jui Jitsu, i have trained in them for almost fice years once this year is over. I even went to thailand and trained kickboxing there in the Fiartex camp i stayed there a long time basically life was training all day.


I came across Krav Maga when i first started Jui Jitsu, there was a guy teaching it in town and it got alot of hype it was very effectively advertized in the united states and it attracted many people of the age-group 21years+ , I think the organization made most of its money selling single women a false-sense of security in that if they learnt this they could take on any person in a dark parking lot. Since i only saw one person teaching it i wont judge all Krav Maga academies, but i must say i'm not impressed by how quickly someone can get certified to teach it its pretty much paying for a certification regardless of wether you are good or not. And as for real life or competition performance to show for it, we had several MMA competiton no holds barred and the Krav Maga guys and the streetfighters were the only guys going to the hospital ER in those events! And then the instructor would disown them and say they were the &amp;quot;lazy students&amp;quot; thats why they lost!

Martial arts politics is so corrupt i know.

I personally am not a Jui-Jitsu fanatic at all, jui jitsu was just one stop in my martial arts journey and i got the chance to start the class here thats why i am happy to teach it i really like the group of people in my class they all have long martial art backgrounds and they want to complete their knowledge by learning a comprahensive ground fighting style like Jui jitsu.

My personal progress though i am working with a friend and we are putting together our conclusion from all these years of martial arts into one final MMA style and we've designed all our groundwork to atually shut-dwon jui-jitsu!! Kind of contradicts that i'm teaching the class but you cant move ahead if you stay in the same spot!


Once again istead of answering your question i have written a whole lifestory! i apologize for that.
The class format is students arrive 5-10 minutes before and warm up so that we waste as little as possible from the one hours provided. Then class starts we quickly review the key-techniques from last class, then i show new moves and they practice them with a partner, usually 3-5 techniques a day. Then the last 20 minutes we free-train which is sparring but actually called rolling since its on the ground.


You get to apply what you learned, or improvise or do whatever, rolling is the best part because you can go full speed and full power without hurting anybody you just tap when you are caught in a submission.  As opposed to striking where you cant really spar full power all the time or else you will get hurt.

Sparring/rolling is really what gives you the confidence in using these techniques! If you just learn the demostrations and never apply them then when the time comes to really use them you wont be able to!</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>How long have you been in Qatar?  I do not think you have been here long…. If you are new and you drive, then wait and see a few Land Cruisers cut you off, make your heart come to your mouth with their speed limit breaking speeds and piss you off by flashing their lights behind you in the fast lane and honking at you at roundabouts like they got shit in their pants.

I have been here for 15 years and I have not seen anything change with regards to the way Qatari’s drive. Like MunozC Mentioned it’s a downright attitude problem... They just think, I can drive in my country the way I like and get away with it, you drive and be careful and weep when you try to mess with me.

I have friends who have had skirmishes with these guys at times and they have insulted them and even gone to the extent of try to hit them when they have been proved wrong, right in front of the cops. One Indian friend was insulted so bad that the Qatari guy said you Indians are at par with my shoes and that’s how you always will be and went on to try and hit him. Now these are one off incidents and does not completely relate to the general Qatari population who drive but I would say a good proportion of them are nasty especially the young ones when it comes to getting behind the wheel. If I had a chance to launch a missile at every land cruiser that has cut me of I am pretty sure I would have reduced the total number by 50 % by now. I personally would like to declare war on every Qatari owning a land cruiser, they are crazy about it and its is not uncommon to find kids driving them, now these machines are monsters and are to be treated with respect. I own one and I drive it, but it has to be tamed and unleashing its inner strength in a care free abandon manner is not something to joke about, but hey, to most Qatari’s who own one, its is a toy and they don’t give a crap if they cut you of or drive down the parking lane at break neck speed during a traffic jam, and squeeze into the smallest gap to get to the front of the line.


The cops say a lot but don’t give a crap, a lot of times you’ll find them speeding down a 60KmPh road at 120KMph, they just don’t’ practice what they preach. Once a rule comes out in the paper you will find several articles in the next day’s paper regarding the number of vehicles and people caught and blah blah blah…. But that is for the first few weeks then everything is back to normal and al hell breaks loose…the cops are not consistent with their raids and need to change their attitude towards enforcing the law, not wait till there is a scream from their bosses or the public…

I drive fast when I know I have a clearing. I have seen people speed through compounds. I find it nice that when you're on a 2 lane road and there is a bit of a wait at the r/a; people make 4 lanes. Crazy.</RelCClean>

PS, to anyone else hitting this thread, initial reaction after call with Craig from Mirage (RE Agent who posts in QL)was very positive! Responded to a single post here in QL with a call half a day later, call was very easy and he understood exactly what I was requesting, followed it up with confirmation of same in several emails that same day! Calling off corporate relo agent to see how Mirage plays out. So far very impressed.

			<RelCBody>The Westbay CC area is pretty small, so you should be able to drive yourself around and visit each building. (maybe a dozen buildings)   I think they all have onsite management that can show you what is available.  Personally, I think the Pearl and Falcon Towers adjacent to the 4 Seasons Hotel are the best units and best located especially if you are able to join the Four Seasons Spa / Health Club.  Al Farden Tower (where the BMW dealer is located) is very nice, but no balconies if that is important to you. 44 Westbay Tower also has very nice units and great views from the upper floors.

Royal Canin can be purchased at the veterinary surgery.

Good luck on your move.  :)

			<RelCBody>Alyson, you can get Royal Canin for cats here, I always buy the hairball control at Doha Vets. If they don't have the specific for persians, they'll probably order it for you. I think their website is www.dohavets.com or something like that.

If I may suggest, if you use an enclosed litter box, bring one with you, as they are very expensive here (QR250 for a really cheap looking one). Also bring toys, they are not easy to find here. And stuff like nail clipper as well. Oh, and frontline is also quite expensive here, and I haven't found the specific one for cats, the vet told me to simply put less of the dog one. Anyway, those are the things you should know if you're bringing kittie with you.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>you're wasting money if you buy a cat/kitten from the pet shops.


Most often, these poor creatures are not fed properly, sick and by the time you get them, you'll be spending lots of money taking them to the vet, and eventually they will die.


We're telling you coz we know...but if you really want a headache...go ahead. Just dont come around moaning that you've been duped and fleeced by these pet shop owners.</RelCBody>

I hope you had a fantabulous weekend!

If you know where I could get some piranha that would be awesome! I wanna get some for my uncles birthday cause he just loves them!!</RelQBody>

Also there's the pet supply shop in the old souq.

			<RelCBody>Body sugaring is a method for removing body hair that is a cheap, homemade alternative to waxing (or shaving). The theory behind body sugaring is that the hair is removed by the root, and when it grows back there will be less of it, and it will be softer and not stubbly as it is if a razor had been used.
Body sugaring is done by making a paste of sugar, water, and lemon juice that has been heated to the softball candy stage.

			<RelCBody>I came back from Europe last week with 2+ kilos in my checked bag - as did at least a dozen others on the same flight.

Alcohol will be confiscated, no doubt about it, but the pork seems to be winked at as it goes through the scanner.

I've never heard of anyone being detained or arrested for bringing either into the country - the alcohol was simply confiscated and they were warned not to try and bring it again.

Nationality and ethnicity may play a role here.  I'm a white Western middleaged female.  Asian and other people of colour may have a different experience and perhaps someone can speak to that point.

Many Westerners here travel to UAE or Bahrain and bring back pork with no incident (in my 2+ years here).

What I don't inderstand is why you are against non muslims drinking alcohol in a sensible moderate way. Is it because you believe that alcohol may be too much of a temptaion to muslims? Do tell me. I am very curious to know your reasons.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>the Al Waha club is a recreation facility within the Al Khor Community gates meaning it serves people working in RasGas and Qatargas. Such clubs inside this kind of facility DO NOT serve alcohol.

There is no beer sold in supermarkets or convenience stores.

As said above only those with a QDC Liquor permit will be able to get some booze and drink it &amp;quot;at home&amp;quot;.

If you still want to go &amp;quot;a club&amp;quot; and get a few drinks then you (and your friend/friends) will have to drive to Doha.

			<RelQSubject>Make up?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hello everyone,

I have recently moved to Doha, i was based in the UAE before and whenever i wanted to buy cosmetics(make up) i would go to specific small shops to get them, the reason behind this was the price would be about 30% less than the perfumes in fancy stores at malls. And yes, the products were absolutely genuine.

Sme brans i bought were estee lauder, loreal, bobbi brown.

So, are there such shops in Doha too? If yes, please give me their location.
Thank you.

			<RelCBody>Yesterday you were asking about branded Perfumes. Today it is make up and for your information branded cosmetics like Estee Lauder, Bobbi Brown, Lancome etc. are not sold in small shops or in the souqs. If you are looking for a mass brand like Rimmel, Bourjois etc. you can get it from Lulu Hypermarket. If you are looking for Branded items you must pay the full price in the showrooms like Faces, Salam, 4U, Pari Gallery, 51 East, Sephora etc.

Could you please tell me which shops in UAE are selling those brands you mentioned at 30% cheaper?</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>As you told it is your 2nd sponsor, it mean you transfor your old visa to the new sponsor, so i think he dont have any problem to give you release bcoz he did'nt buy your visa, he hired you localy, but even though everything is in his hand, most of the companies are not giving release, bcoz they bought visas and if they release it mean they are giving visa, but in your case you just transfor your visa to the new company, so i think if you request him when he is in good mood, i hope he'll deal you good, InshaAllah

			<RelCBody>laidahmad
agree with sanooj.
-who were u trying to bring? if close family members usually there is no problem, but i know many who saw refusal to bring mother-in-law, or distant relatives
-is ur accomodation a family one? if ur contract says bachelor accomodation is provided, than they may refuse it.
-is ur occupation compatible with the 9000 qr? a driver/maid/construction worker for example (just an example, no bashing) say that he gets 9.000, the commission may doubt it.

just ask them why they refused the application, and accordingly bring proofs (rental copy or a  kahrama bill to proove a family accomo, 6 months bank statement if they doubt ur salary, family documents to prouve family ties,...)

			<RelCBody>IN THE CASE FAMILY VISIT VISA;

- marriage certificate or birth certificate need NOT to be attested.


- NO need of Company Letter for each, only one letter but copy should be attached with each applications.

- No need of Baladiya Stamp on Rental Agreement. Just to get a Rental Agreement from a Real Estate License holder.

Try to prepare all the documents before you go to MOI. If one they rejected, it is very difficult to get it approved.

Good Luck!</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>just by living in Doha, you should learn English fairly quick.

Here are some pointers


- Speak English at home, ban any other language
- Always try to use subtitles when watching TV/DVD
- Only listen to English Music

- Only read English books, papers etc etc


Youngsters absorb language fairly quick and in my humble opinion do not need tutoring, as they will get English in school either way.  </RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>I have been in touch with Volys Star a Belgian company producing salami, ham, etc www.volysstar.be

Here is the list of gluten free products available at Carrefour, MegaMarkt and Hyatt


    10190    Smoked Turkey Breast
    10490    Grilled Turkey Roll
    11290    Grilled Turkey Breast
    15890    Peppered Turkey Breast    (*** very good)
    17090    Chicken Breast 100% 'Chico'
    18090    Italian Chicken Roll
    83190    Turkey Smokes Salami style   (*** very good)

At Carrefour Villageo, a soy sauce GF is available : Castelo (from Bresil) nao contem gluten. To find it, go to the mustard section. It is hidden there with other sauces

At Megamarkt, you can also find :
- GF beef and vegetable stock.
- plenty of biscuits such as TruFree, Crackers from Barkat, rice crackers from Fantastic,
- cereal bars such as Cranberry &amp;amp; Raisin OK
- pasta
But you will have to go through the shelves as they are not in a GF section but among other products.

At Lulu, 3 or 4 produts from Sh?r are now available. I had contact with the representative in Bahrein and was expecting a more complete range


For the time being, I work in collaboration with a chef of a 5* hotel trying to provide breads, cakes, biscuits and  lets dream croissants, pains au chocolat
As soon as we are satisfied by this baked products, I will post a contact address

Bon apptit !

			<RelCBody>As promised on my previous post, I'm very glad to inform you that gluten free bread can be ordered at the bakery corner of La Cigale Hotel.

The pastry chef prepares white bread, pesto bread, tomato bread and thyme bread. He can also bake small sandwiches.
He also offers delicious cookies.

You will have to place your order one or two days in advance as this is a special preparation requesting a place and baking instruments completely free of gluten.

We eat these breads since a few week and are very satisfied.

			<RelCBody>You can probably order your GF bread from La Cigale by phone but I think that, the 1st time, it is better to go to the bakery counter or to the casher.

Try to get a phone contact or an email for the next orders. Sorry but I may not give you the contacts I got there...

The price for a 1/2 kg bread is 50 QAR. It is not cheap but compared to the bread sold in Megamarkt, it is cheap AND better.

You can contact me through this email adress : gf.jodemaere@spamgourmet.com

			<RelCBody>shortening is available all over, try the oil aisles, down with the ghee.  i think i bought mine in the carrefour in city centre.

haven't seen bran, haven't really looked though.  not sure its that readily available?  try the cold cereal aisle? perhaps that explains the rather white brown bread.  the rye bread i bought today must have had only 1 grain of rye as well.  was delicious, but not very strong in the rye department.


another ingredient that seems to be fairly rare is baking soda. can always find baking powder.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>yes, I bake, a LOT!! You can find shortening (Crisco) at Carrefours and/or Megamart, or ShopRite, occasionally. Wheat bran I saw at Megamart just this morning with the other grains....3rd aisle from the left of the store, back section(I believe!)

Postmodernman...baking soda is now readily available at Megamart and Shoprite on a regular basis. If you have problems, look for Bicarbonate of Soda..same thing.

Ohh and I just found Jif peanut butter at Megamart...yeah!!!

			<RelCBody>Megamart does have the best selection. Edensoy milk is some of the best tasting (especially vanilla). It comes fortified in some varieties. Read labels on everything. If the product is from the US, it will list CONTAINS MILK in bold letters on the bottom of the ingredients. Some poptarts are milk free (cinnamon, strawberry, and apple flavor). Be cautious with chocolate. Milk is in all Cadbury chocolate. Some dark brands are vegan. Megamart also has Soya margarine and &amp;quot;Smart Balance&amp;quot; butterflavored spread on occasion. My advice is to stock up when they have it! Also be careful when buying bread, as many have milk as an ingredient. I haven't found any dairy-free cheese in doha. Is the allergy just cow's milk? Can goat or sheep cheese be used?

The pharmacy in City Center has chewy bears calcium vitamins if you are looking for supplements. Good luck.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>This works with any white fish fillets. It's particularly nice with parrot fish. Examine the fillets closely, and remove any scales and bones missed by the fishmonger.

Fry some finely chopped onion until soft, then add crushed garlic, diced carrot and celery, with a little salt. Cover and sweat for five minutes.

Add about 500mL vegetable stock and simmer until the vegetables are cooked. Remove the vegetables with a sieve, then cook the fish fillets in the simmering stock until the flesh has set (no more than 10 minutes).

Serve the fish and vegetables with creamy mashed potato.

			<RelCBody>yes, the reason is that when the site is slow, which happens every now and then, the preview function makes it even more annoying and slow to post a comment.


I dont think it serves to any purpose. I never bother to re-read what I type and and roll down to press submit as quickly as possible... I dont think that the preview function will stop some people from posting BS at times....I wonder how many members &amp;quot;really&amp;quot; preview their comments before posting? </RelCBody>

What do you think of blind dating? Anyone tried it before?

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
To tell you the truth I blind dated once and it was the longest hour in my life. I was counting seconds to leave since nothing from what my friend discribed appeared to be true. (I smacked her head after that)

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Share your opinion &amp;amp;amp; experiences.

hey, next time get yourself to a place where u r comfy, with ppl around. dont go walking alone with him anywhere...especially dark places. there are plenty of hangouts like that. make it semi-blind. dont budge out with a complete stranger unless your heart tells you so.

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
always take pride in yourself and limit yourself not to be opening up on the first note... show that you care about your womanhood..

They come to Doha used to driving and walking like this - no lanes, no rules, no traffic lights, and continue behaving exactly the same way on the streets of Doha. Can't wait for the police to enforce the new traffic rules...

Lara123: There are enough Brazilian football players in Doha, but definitely much less than indian drivers.

Btw. I see no point in you guys attacking Brazilians (for your info, I am not a Brazilian). Pointing fingers will not change the fact that the majority of the drivers on the Doha roads are your compatriots, and the &amp;quot;industrial&amp;quot; (especially those who drive white TATA buses with workers) drivers shouldn't be given license even to walk.

People from all countries are residing in Najma area...there are Pionys, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Somalians, Egyptians and all others.,,why to blame it on only Indian drivers? The roads are so conjusted with the unique beautiful design of biiiiig roundabouts and smaaaaal circulating roads. Still I am yet to observe any big accident on these roads, believe me as I am a daily commuter on these roads.

You have to agree the fact that behind every accident there is a SUV, fortunately not driven by subcontinent drivers.

			<RelCBody>Dear Rajeeb,

Trust exchange of Qatar managed by State bank of India opens NRI account from Qatar. The required documents are. Passport copy, QID and visa page copy, two photos, and INR DD on your name (DD you can take from Trust exchange itself) then Trust exchange manager will sign the documents after verified.

Once he signed you have send the documents by post to your nearst branch in India. After 15- 25 days you will get passbook, chq book and ATM card and all.

Hope this answer would help in your question.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>According to my experience, open NRI direct account with commercial Bank &amp;amp; ICICI bank, this gives you current account in commercial bank, NRE account in ICICI bank &amp;amp; if you are interested in Share/mutual fund online trading then ICICI online trading account facility is best. you can transfer money from commercial bank account to your ICICI NRE account online &amp;amp; transfer happens in one working day.

Also I would like to mention one point here that for online money transfer, Dohabank exchange rates are always better than commercial bank, so for me I have also opened a Dohabank saving account which I use for online money transfer to ICICI NRE account &amp;amp; This transfer is also fast, most of the time one working day. </RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>My experience with Doha Bank-Axis bank for the past 3 years has been very satisfactory. The transfers online occur instantly most of the time and the rates offered by Doha bank are the best in here compared to all other banks and the exchange houses. The customer service by Axis bank in India ( at least in Kochi, Kerala) is excellent. I do have an SBI NRE account but I still would prefer remittances done to Axis bank as the money gets credited to Axis bank accounts much faster than to SBI accounts. </RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>1 - If you leave with any bank debts/credit card debts/bad checks, this will create a problem for your sponsor.  In that case the sponsor might blacklist you from getting a work visa in Qatar or anywhere else in the GCC. Additionally if there are issues with the bank, they may send a collection agency after you even in your home country to recover any money that you owe.
2 - There could be problems, it depends on point 1.

3 - The bank account will technically remain active. It doesn't close down at the expiration of your RP, otherwise all Qatar residents would need to go to the bank every time they renew their RP. If you have a monthly account fee over time this will bring the account into negative balance, creating a potential problem for you and your sponsor.

Leave peacefully and do the right thing by your sponsor. If you leave by going on holiday and not coming back you are only going to make a problem for yourself later.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Well I think its a rip off. No such thing as the best bank. I left Doha Bank because of poor customer service and went to QNB which am happy with.

With QNB, you have to have a minimum of Qr 3,000 in your current account always. Its a compulsory savings scheme.

Plus, you get .25% in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5%.

Be careful, read the small prints. I don't trust banks here.

			<RelCBody>get her to rule out any medical condition first for being overweight...always related to hormones.....u say she has been overweight for a few months...pls get it checked.
if there is a hormonal imbalance u will put on weight....then you put on more weight and the hormonal imbalance keeps on...its a vicious cycle....

exercise n proper diet...which means low fats and meals ateast 5 times a day...but small meals.

how long does she exercise.......u need to really workout max of 80mins to bring about weight loss....new study......

keep a target of 3 months to see some proper weight loss and u have to keep at it.

i dont know of xenical...have heard of actrim which is fruit extracts.

#1... you can get fried rice at HOT CHICKEN for QR 12-15 (veg, or chicken, or chinese-style, or mixed, etc.) ... best thing about it = free delivery~!!!
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;nbsp;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
me and my colleagues totally depend on HOT CHICKEN delivery for lunch everyday... haha

&amp;amp;nbsp;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
hmm.. yday I had a taste of camel meat at Souq.. I found the texture more toward chicken than beef.. but the taste of the &amp;amp;quot;baby camel&amp;amp;quot; cooked in some &amp;amp;quot;traditional way&amp;amp;quot; reminded me of tasting plastic after you pour hot water into the PET bottles.. don't know why...
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;nbsp;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
does anybody else have the same taste buds as myself? =)
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;nbsp;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
By the way, talking about Souq.. does anybody know about the &amp;amp;quot;WIND TOWER&amp;amp;quot;? apparently it's the ethnographic museum on Grand Hamad St near Souq... but it's closed.. according to Marhaba... so, does anybody knows anywhere else to explore wind towers? thx...

1) No, they are not ashamed to tell anyone they are from India, they just assume that you have figured it out that they are from India (it's not that hard to figure it out) and ur asking where they belong to from India....!!! get the point..!!

2)Well asking too many questions is to get to know the person sooner or to know his/her background....u dont have to sweat/worry about it...

I'm moving to Doha in April and I've been trying to research what the current Interest rates are for Vehicle and Personal loans as I will more than likely be needing a loan for a car whilst I am out there.


I've managed to find the Commercial bank rate and QNB rate but I cant seem to find HSBC.


Does anyone know what it is please?


I'm looking at borrowing between 60,000 - 100,000 QR

			<RelCBody>typically here the interest on Vehicles are almost identical with small differences no more than 1/2 percentile.  On personal loans, I am not sure but banks take time before issuing them.


Banking here is different from the west.  when you arrive to work here your company usually has facilities with certain banks so you can only take facilities from those banks (you can open in any bank a savings account but you will not get any facilities with it).  some of the larger companies can send your salary to any bank and then it is up to you to choose.  Note that Vehicle loans tend to be straight forward as the bank co-owns your vehicle until you pay your loan back however, personal loans take more time (at least a couple of month where your salary is transferred regularly) before it is approved. Here, there is no credit history that you can transfer with you.  it is all about where your salary gets transferred and which company is sponsoring you.

Bottom line, don't bother with researching any other bank as rates will be similar.  the most important factor for me was how close is the branch to my work :-)</RelCBody>

			<RelQBody>Hi,

I'll be moving to Doha for work and would like to use HSBC Qatar for my banking since I'm already using them in my home country.

Are those using their services in Qatar, may I check, are their services good and speedy? Are charges reasonable (it's expensive here)? Do they have extensive ATM? Do they pay interests for our saving? How about their premier a/c? Is it worth opening such a/c?

Thanks.

			<RelCBody>e643 is right and they have narrow opening hours so i can only go on saturday mornings and sit and wait and wait.

i have been a customer for almost 4 yrs and i dont like them. i have removed most of my money and go in to remove my salary every two months.  cancelled all my cards with them.

QNB is good because their opening hours are much more convenient.
also they have branches in shopping malls so parking isn't the big issues like hsbc.

check out their website.

they still have big queues in some branches......my friend went in took a ticket, went home, made her breakfast, ate, tidied up, drove back to QNB and still was in a queue - ha ha

but that is most banks here!

banks do islamic and non-islamic banking so u can do either.
i have a financial consultant who does my savings for me independent of any bank in qatar.</RelCBody>

I bank with Doha Bank and have a personal loan. I've just realised that they have increased the interest rate by 2% sometime in the last 2-3 months without even bothering to inform me. A phonecall to the bank has proved useless as usual.

I'm off to the bank now in person, lets see what happens.

I'd be on the lookout if you do bank with them.

What was really amusing was how I was told this is an International Bank (???) and keeps up with the markets hence interest rates can go up and down. I don't seem to recall them going down when the US Dollar hit rock bottom!!!

Also regarding not informing me about the increase....'we have 1000's of customers we can't tell everybody!' I wish I could say they were saving the environment by not sending out letters but what's the excuse for not sending an email or text?

Anyway long story short, I'm moving banks and am very glad to, good riddance to old rubbish. I do wish I could meet the people who gave them all those awards for 'Excellence in banking' etc we must not be talking about the same Doha Bank.

Goodluck to all those who continue to bank with them.</RelCBody>

re-read the post, nothing to do with late payment, just a general across-the-board increase in interest rates. Basically the bank trying to squeeze every penny out of people (especially those who have being paying on time, because this would mean they have the money, no use trying to get money out of someone who doesn't have it)to cover any losses they may have sustained while 'playing' the markets.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Hi Lamea!

im kinda new in here but what I know about islamic banking is that they got much lower rates and a certain portion is donated to their Muslim Communities who need help - gotta think from the more positive angle since we are living in their world we gotta live by it. Otherwise go to America or Europe instead but for me Islam and Islamic banking is good.

Just a thought.  No offense meant ok?

			<RelCBody>Good to read the positive comments about most banks. Sort of revives my confidence in the banks here.

I went to one and talked to the 'customer relationship officer' about opening an account and to each one of my question, he had to guess an answer :)

any how, i guess only experience will tell.

			<RelCBody>Hi Casanova, I'm sorry to disappoint you with this,
HSBC is just like any other bank in Doha, and it's even worse because they charge for every thing.
Don't be amused by this word (The World's Local Bank), they are right in it's local, but it's not universal.
you can ask them about something to do with another HSBC world wide, they will tell you: sorry, there is no networks between our banks in the world, so it's just local bank.

I'm telling you this, since I'm dealing with five different bank in Qatar, and HSBC was even lower level than others, it's just a big name, the only good thing about them, that they provide you parking in the main branch in Banks street.

I think Doha, Almashreq, and the commercial banks are better options.

Best regards

			<RelCBody>just my 5 cent worth of opinion: not all the things you need, you should buy abroad just because they are more expensive in doha. i wouldnt buy a baby cot and brought it over to doha. likewise for diapers (pampers). how many packs of pampers can you buy from abroad for a good one year supply, just because they might be cheaper abroad. my opinion is you should consider buying things, which are not in Qatar, from your home country. even if you try to avoid paying more on baby stuff, you will eventually spend more on something else out here and at the same time paying less for other things too, like car and petrol. </RelCBody>

If you're shipping a container over from the uk then my advise would be to bring E V E R Y T H I N G and more :) It's painful to pay 3 if not 4 times as you would back home. Wipes are ripoff. I bought almost everything for my kids in the uk but my husband (aaargh) dissuaded me from buying the next size up car seat for my son that would have costed me 110-120 from mothercare/halfords but it costs 260 in mc here. needless to say i'll wait til januari when the inlaws are coming.... </RelCBody>

Not that QA stopped its quality service, but if you draw a price-quality graph on various airlines, it is not so great. What is the big deal to have better quality, to give 40% more !!!!!!....

			<RelCBody>heloo2020,
Chances of you getting a job there now are very slim.
I dont think you will immediately adjust to the country. It takes years when things go right, but at the moment life isn't easy there (high unemployment and huge tax loads).
If you have a family to take care of, perhaps it would be wiser not to take risks when you have little chances to succeed.
Take leave (don't disclose the reason to your employer) and go there to assess personally the situation.
Good luck!</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>I have seen numerous cases of people getting Canadian visas and having no intention to work there. They base their families there and continue working in the Gulf with higher packages (because of the new passport).

So, it all comes down to what your REAL intentions are. I would go with Baldricl's suggestion that you do the honourable thing and resign. perhaps you could get a commitment from your employer that he would consider taking you back in six months time if needed.

Good luck anyway :)</RelCBody>

			<RelQSubject>Revoked job offers in Doha?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hello,

I just accepted a job offer from a post production company almost 2 weeks ago.  However , this new employer advised me &amp;quot;not to resign from my work yet&amp;quot; and to wait for their go signal. But they still asked for employment requirements from me, like passport, education documents, etc.

What could be the reason why I couldn't resign yet? Is there a chance that they would revoke my job offer? Based on what reasons?

Thanks a lot.</RelQBody>

I went to Thailand for 3 weeks at Christmas/New Year and visited a few different places, but if you only have 5 days then you'll probably only be able to do one place.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Bangkok is probably your best bet as I expect that's where you're flying to/from, and it has plenty to do for 5 days. The Lonely Planet has plenty of good suggestions of what to do, but I can give you more specific ideas if you want.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
We also went to Chiang Mai in the north which is lovely. Still a city with lots to see in and around it, but it seems to have a far more chilled vibe than Bangkok.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
If you fancy proper chilling then I'd recommend down south. We stayed on the Andaman coast at Khao Lak and Ko Lanta (north and south of Phuket respectively). Both had a nice relaxed atmosphere - not as manic as I'm led to believe Phuket is.

			<RelCBody>Use the above sites or Asia Web Direct website (search on Google) to find our info on the hotel you would like to stay at. These sites usually have a great line up of hotels and their basic rates with facilities available including their pictures.

Once you have identified the hotel you would like to stay in, search for the hotel name on google and book the rooms from the hotel website. Majority of hotels offer best rates available in the market thru their own website. Makes sense as they save on commission or brokerage charges from third party websites.

			<RelCBody>Why not try somewhere totally exotic in South East Asia. Thailand, Vietnam, or Malaysia caters from the 5 star to budget travellers.

Air fares with Qatar Airways is approx QR3,000 to Thailand, you may find cheaper fares with Gulf Air, leaving you QR 2,000 for hotels etc.

Take a look at Air Asia's web site. It is SE Asia's budget airline and can fly you cheaply and connecting you to nearby neighbouring countries and has many hotel prices listed too. If time is not an issue you can also take the bus from say Malaysia to Thailand, or Thailand to Vietnam or Cambodia.

Best of luck

Ql members are easily identifiable in a crowd. Just watch out for the following characteristics.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
a) The males will have long flowing beard (Look at my avatar for an idea about how it would look), which will be always unkempt and unruly. If there is a bird which has nested in his beard, that means he is the most senior among them and also the wisest. I tried to make a nest in my beard and invite a bird in, but none would touch it. I wonder why?
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
b) b) The females will almost always have flowing, shiny, silver hair and they will have eyes lined in VIBGYOR  all colours of the rainbow. The more colours they have around their eyes, the more senior in QL they are. Age does not come in here. All of them are very young and nubile. Its very easy to find them in a crowded place because if two QL ladies get together, they will start singing my heart will go on at the top of their voices.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
c) HABITAT&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
They are usually found near beaches and shopping malls where they go away for their hunting trips. It could be crabs, fishes or anything in between. Some of them live inside their land cruisers, while others run behind their Harley Davidson motorcycles. Almost no one walks on the roads. Thos who dont have cars, simply fly.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
P.S: It is also said that there is something called a QL Social Group in here somewhere. Its tougher to find it than the proverbial abominable snowman or even the holy grail. The clues are strewn all over Qatar Living. If you find it in your life time, become a member and there will still be further clues as to where the secret meetings of the QL members take place.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
I am 102 years old now. The last 80 years of my life were spent searching for the enigmatic brotherhood, sisterhood and ya-ya-hood of the QL. If you get the key, please do share. There have been men and women who died searching for it
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The other day, i met one of the most senior members of QL - Darude. Each time he shook hands with a person, two birds came out through the two sides of his beard singing &amp;amp;quot;cuckoo, cuckoo&amp;amp;quot;. I envied him. I didnt have even ONE bird in my beard while he had two.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
I also saw a few bisuit crumbs on his beard. I have a strong suspicion that he is using Britania bisuits to lure the birds into his beard.

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
I have made a proposal to the birds saying that i would give them swiss chocolate biscuits if they relocated. Lets see how the negotiations go. Will have to stamp their RP's very soon so that they dont leave me anytime soon.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Note to self: Give birds Residence permit, land cruiser allowance, two way tickets (even if they can fly on their own) and a free hand in doing what they will with their nest s, provided it will ALWAYS remain within MY beard!

			<RelCBody>I don't know if it's a waste of time but I DO find it confusing.

Hub gets Friday off and Saturday AFTERNOON ???  What's that all about!  Really cuts into the 'break' and means Friday evening out is a 'no no'.

I think they use Saturday morning to hold meetings to catch up on events, but I often forget it's a half day and get a surprise (pleasant) when hub suddenly appears home around 1.00 p.m. or earlier.

Anywhere else I've lived in the Middle East the week end has been Thursday and Friday with, maybe, Thursday afternoon as well as Friday being the time off.</RelCBody>

If I'm working that day or just plainly off, I'm still getting paid while I'm in Doha.
That is the positive side about it.

If I was Back in the US, I probably be trying to work that day.

- What to expect in regards to the process of getting the visa? HUH dont you already have a visa to come to Qatar? If you already do, then you will have to go for medical examination after the first month, do your finger printing. If they find you have Aids or any such sicknesses you'll be put on the next flight back to Canada.
- What to bring? What to leave behind? Bring whatever you feel is necessary for the first few days after you arrive here in Qatar. Pots and pans if you are going to cook. Furnished aprts here means you'll have a cooker, may be washing machine fridge, beds etc. not sure you have to find that out. Leave behind unwanted clothes, shoes, electronics (voltage different here)
- What to expect when we arrive? HOT HOTTER HOTTEST TIME OF THE YEAR!

- Are there any types of items we should stock up on prior to moving and ship with us? Hmm if you think u cant live without certain tin food products then carry that along, however the Canadian folks here might have a better clue on what is and what is not available here. Mega mart and mostly all the big mall supermarkets have all you need :)

Good Fortune always comes knocking at your door...when you are sh*tting in the toilet!! :)

			<RelCBody>Hi,Canadian Luda

Moving to Qatar in mid-August is a no no.But if you have no choice...Why do I say that??Because the weather is awful.But once you get to Oct-Nov. you will enjoy it.
Regarding the shipment,there is no point in doing that since the company will provide you with a fully furnished appartment/villa.You will find everything here(house-holds,china,etc)at a reasonable price.
Visa-it depends on how fast the company  you will be working for is.
What to expect when you arrive??hhhmm...difficult question.A lot of dust,heat and a lot of humidity :)
I don't know how much you know about Qatar.But if you have any questions just let me know.
Cheers

			<RelCBody>tough time to move.  I moved in August as well.  but atleast you can comfort yourself in knowing you're hitting the worst weather by that time and its only positive from then on.

Quick addition:   I do suggest you actually move with stuff... especially if you and your partner are doing this together.  clothing is expensive here and if it's just 'your own stuff' that you want around the house, pack a few boxes of clothes you want, pics, music or books or whatever.   everything retail and consumable is expensive.
As for a moving company.... I've used Crown Relocations on all of my last 3 moves between countries and they are top notch in every place.

Visa stuff... let the employer take are of that.  I can recommend that you have at minimum 2 certified and originals of all legal documents (birth certs, marriage certs, etc.)... it is easier if you need them later on than having to wait to obtain them. Plus, if you can even get one of each certified by the Qatar consulate in Canada before you go (you can just send  money and the certificate and its done and couriered back within like 7-10 days), youre' a big step ahead and won't need to do it here if you find you need it for any reason.

dont bring thick sweaters!!!!  I thought that even though I'd acclimate to the Gulf winters.... I still didn't find myself needing the 'nanook of the north' jackets and sweaters.  A light jacket and a couple layerable sweaters will take care of you both.

Dont bring drugs with you (i.e. anything with Codiene, etc.) ....  even cold medication... atleast on the plane.  I stocked up on Nyquil in a big supply before I left and put it in my container....Do some checking on the type of drugs you can bring with you in the country.  Any prescription stuff - make sure you have a certified doctors note with you... I made that mistake once and it took me 4 hours to get through customs.

			<RelCBody>yup....u've got a point there about westerners not listening to asian music....but the channel is not going to cater only to QL members,y'see.it's for the entire country!think of all those constructions workers out there (a vast majority of whom are asians) who could plug their ears with a pair of earphones connected to their mobiles(i'm sure almost all mobiles today have an inbuilt FM system)and work!they have no penchant for english music as many of them do not understand the language.listening to music from their countries will definitely make them feel a wee bit less homesick at least!and for all those people from the west,there's always QBS!:-)

			<RelCBody>It would be awesome if we had our own Hindi channel. I am a Pakistani but I love hindi movies and music. I do listen to radio 4 FM 89.1 and city FM 101.6 but we do not get them all year round. Only when the weather is calm and not windy. We don't get it all during the winter. It is a very good suggestion and I do believe Qatar should have its own 24 hour hindi FM channel. If we can have 24 hour English channel on FM 97.5 for the last 30 plus years in Qatar then why not a Hindi channel???? </RelCBody>

I had the same problem as you whilst living in Panama. I am a resident there but with a UK passport. I was going on a 2 day business trip to Mexico and had to renew my passport before I left Panama.

			<RelCBody>I dont think it is necessary to have 6 months validity while you hold a valid Residence Permit. 6 months validity of a PP is required if you are travelling to a country without having a valid visa for that country and you will not get a visa if you does not have 6 months valid Passport as well.

In this case I would suggest you to renew your Passport before you go on leave as you do not have too many days left. You are planning to come back at the end of April and in case if you are not able to travel your Passport will get expired and you will be in trouble. So play safe.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Brit, I might have to disagree with you on this one.


Cost of living in home countries?

I can assure you that in India, some people have a REALLY high cost of living. Like anywhere else, you can get very similar foods/item for very cheap or very expensive. Depends on how rich you are and on your lifestyle.


Average living standards and governmental services vary between a 3rd world country and Europe but that is it.


Plus, if someone is living here, who cares how much a soda can costs back home? Why can't that person Mr (kumar) enjoys his weekend in Qatar like Mr (John) does with his family?

I bet you Mr kumar's kids and wife would like to have gourmet food every once in a while.


I am glad I am white. But nothing pisses me off more than Racism and especially when it gets acknowledged by those who benefit from it! :)

			<RelCBody>Also BE, having worked in HR here for a while, it is common practise for companies to ask what your current salary is and they will base their offers on that. For instance,  2 Civil Engineers, one from the US and one from Philippines you will find that the one from the philppines will be on say 8000QAR and maybe the one from the states will be on 21QAR (in their home country). HR will base their offer on how much extra (or not) they can get away with offering above what they currently earn.


So you can't give someone who is on 8kqar currently over 20k and similarly you cannot offer someone who is on 21k less than that because he thinks, why would I want to come here for less than I am currently earning at home.


Also back to BE's point, rents, mortgages general cost of living in India and Philippines is much less than it is in most of Europe and North america.


And lastly for those that say why not hire all from India etc because there is nothing more detrimental to a good company than hiring all of the same nationality, a good mix of all is the best possible thing</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>what are we here for but to save for a better life when we go home. If someone cannot save for a better life when they go home, will simply not come in the first place and companies have slowly realised that hiring all from one nation does not work, so they have to pay more for a mix of people.

However, what I have noticed is that people from say india who have lived in the ME a while, their salaries do start to become more equitable as they change jobs - based on their current salary and each time they change, voila, their salaries go up. What I also notice is that alot of westerners, their salaries do not change much, they were already being paid the top for what they are doing and cannot get much higher by changing jobs. </RelCBody>

It's obvious ..Just take a look at your passport ; then your counrty Ok. #sigh# now take a deep breath and realise the way your re being treated in your OWN country and compare with the numerous countries you envy; compare the salaries and again the benefits..... The answer is clear ; If we re being treated like Sh*t where we come from You'd be treated the same way any where ...

Maybe you got to try the construction sector, depending on your experience.


The guy who made your Cocktail juice must have been an specialist TV repair man.

The Barber might have been a Computer troubleshooter &amp;amp; repairman.

The A/C mechanic who came to your house &amp;amp; made a mess could have been an expert Cook.

..I hope you are getting my drift. People not necessarily end up in a job they did back home.

Maybe you got to try the construction sector; depending on your experience. The guy who made your Cocktail juice must have been an specialist TV repair man. The Barber might have been a Computer troubleshooter &amp; repairman. The A/C mechanic who came to your house &amp; made a mess could have been an expert Cook. ..I hope you are getting my drift. People not necessarily end up in a job they did back home.</RelCClean>

			<RelCBody>Ur totally right...i believe that its not just happening in Qatar coz it happened to me too. Im currently working in UAE as Project Coordinator/Secretary but if you look at my Visa &amp;amp; Work Permit im a Computer Programmer.
When you come to a point that you become desperate to get a job...you dont really care about the position anymore, whats important is getting paid coz were living in a foreign country &amp;amp; every move we make costs too much.

BTW, guys send to me the email address of your HR for any computer related positions. Thanks so much!</RelCBody>

QR10k seems a little low to live in Qatar where basic foodstuffs are expensive and of poor quality. Personally, if I couldn't be happy with my renumeration knowing I was on a good deal, I'd go home. There at least you'd be in familiar surroundings able to take advantage of other opportunities and more importantly, with your family and friends!

for government section it is higher than that , can reach 30K to 32K.

You only posted less then an hour ago. Give other QLers a chance to see your questions to give answers. I've no idea about how the staff are treated or the salaries but I do know they have quite a good reputation. </RelCBody>

Hi!

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Does anyone know of any Nurseries for Plants in Doha? What kind of Plants do you get there? How feasible is it to have a garden in Doha considering the extreme climate? Any body who has orchids at home? Please lemme know.

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
Thanks in advance

Some people have posted on here before about a larger/wholesale-retail nursery on the way out of town but I've never been there. You could try doing a search on here.

&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;#160;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
I go to FamilyPlant something or other right off Salwa road near the wholesale markets. If you turn offSalwa in between Buchannan furniture there's a whole row ofnurseries.&amp;amp;quot;Family&amp;amp;quot; is towards the end. 
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

SHARIA LAW

http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/03/24/10027928.html

The Sharia: How it affects you 

By Bassma Al Jandaly, Staff Reporter
Published: November 02, 2007, 01:19



You could be sharing an apartment with a friend of the opposite sex. And the arrangement could be innocent, purely for financial reasons. But in the eyes of Sharia law you are committing an offence.


More and more people are being punished because they claim they were unaware of the law and its clauses.


There are hundreds of cases such as these that emerge each year either from the police or the courts. An increasing number of men and women, who are not blood relatives nor legally married, and have shared a flat, room or even sat in tinted cars, are being jailed and deported, a lawyer said. These men and women have shared no relationship.


Dr Adel Khamis Al Mimari from Al Itazan Consultant and Advocates said they are being punished in accordance with Sharia law. The clause is known as &amp;quot;Tawajed&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Tahseen Al Ma'asiya&amp;quot;. These couples have been punished under this clause: sharing a closed place and encouraging sin even though they shared no relationship.


He told Gulf News: &amp;quot;The bottom line is awareness. Many foreigners are not familiar with Sharia law and hence they are punished. If these couples go unnoticed, then there is no trouble. But if the authorities for some reason or another know they are sharing a ?closed space' they can be punished. This is the law.&amp;quot;


All about respect


&amp;quot;These couples believe they are leading a normal life, like they would in their home countries. But this is considered a sin here. Filipino nationals top the list of nationalities who fall into this trap followed by Indians, Europeans and Chinese. People should be educated about this issue to avoid problems.&amp;quot;


Dr Ahmad Al Qubaisi, a leading Islamic scholar, told Gulf News that every nation has its culture and traditions. Each nation should respect others.


&amp;quot;Westerners respect each other and they know their countries' traditions and laws. So why when it comes to Muslims they claim that they do not know anything about the traditions and culture? The West knows well that Muslims, like Hindus, Christians and Jews, have their culture and traditions. They should respect our religion,&amp;quot; Dr Al Qubaisi said.


The tradition


&amp;quot;Our tradition is against a man and woman, who are not legally related, mingling privately or being in a closed place alone, while in the West they can have a sexual relationship even though they are not married. Our traditions are very different,&amp;quot; Dr Al Qubaisi said.


&amp;quot;We see many such cases of foreign men and women in courts. They say they do not know the traditions and religion here. They should know and respect our tradition the same way we respect their tradition and religion,&amp;quot; he said.


The sentence


Dr Khalifa Rashid Al Sha'ali, Dean of the Faculty of Law at Ajman University, said if a man and a woman who are not related are caught alone in a private place, they face a jail sentence or lashes even if they were not involved in any suspicious act.


It is up to the judge's discretion to decide whether they should be deported.


Dr Al Sha'ali, a former Ajman Police Chief, told Gulf News that during his tenure, he dealt with several such cases.


Mohammad Yousuf, Deputy Director of the Dubai Courts Department, said while the Federal punitive law is implemented in the UAE, the situation is different in Dubai. The Tawajed or Tahseen Al Ma'asiya clause, he said, is not implemented in Dubai.


Sultan Khalifa Bin Bakheet Al Matroushi, Chairman of the Ajman Federal Appeal Court, said if a man and woman are sitting alone in the work place or in front of people, they will not be charged. If they are found in a bedroom or in a house or car and the circumstances are suspicious, they will face charges even if they have not committed adultery. The couple can also be deported, he said.


Justice minister explains the law


Mohammad Bin Nakhira Al Daheri, Minister of Justice, told Gulf News that according to Sharia, if a man and woman are found in a closed place alone they may get arrested, but he gave an assurance that they are held for good reason. He stressed that the police would investigate first.


&amp;quot;If a couple is found alone in a closed place such as a house, room or car they may face legal action. There also must be a complaint against them. However, if their actions are not against public morals such as being in their work place or inside a lift, of course no action would be taken. If police receive a tip that a man and woman are in a closed place, they will investigate and if they are not doing anything against the law they will not be punished.


&amp;quot;There must be a complaint and investigation from police. The public prosecution and the judge can decide if something illegal was going on,&amp;quot; Al Daheri said.


What the people say


Kristina from Macedonia has been living in the UAE for the last six months. She said she has no idea about Sharia law or the clause, which prohibits men and women, who are not blood relatives nor legally married, from sharing a flat, room or even sitting in tinted cars.


&amp;quot;People must have privacy. It is strange that a neighbour or a watchman can call the police if two people are in a private place alone. Why don't people call the police when they hear someone beating up his wife at home?


&amp;quot;Many of us here are not Muslims. We respect Islam and the traditions of this land. Hence, our way of life should also be respected.&amp;quot;


She said it is the responsibility of companies who hire people from abroad to make them aware about Sharia.


&amp;quot;This law does not exist in my country, where it is normal to be with your boyfriend alone in a closed place. I think if companies alert people before they come here, it will help them.&amp;quot;


Mohammad Elias from India is in his 20s and not married. He has been in the UAE for two months, but says he has never heard about the clause.


&amp;quot;I may not agree with the clause, but I do respect the law of the land here, and I think foreigners should adhere to the law,&amp;quot; he said.


Tess Yema from the Philippines works as a teacher in a school in Sharjah and has been here since August. &amp;quot;I am aware of the law. I have a brother-in-law who has been in the UAE for many years. He told me about the clause.


&amp;quot;Before coming to the UAE, the authorities in my country told me about Sharia. I knew these aspects very well before coming here. I respect the law in this country and I respect their way of thinking even if it is different from the one in my country,&amp;quot; Yema said. &amp;quot;I was even told about the dress code here. I knew that if I offended the law I would face punishment,&amp;quot; she said.


Samer Assaf is married with two daughters. His family is in Syria.


&amp;quot;I have been living here for more than 15 years, but I have never heard about this clause, not in my country and not here. I am a Christian, but I respect the traditions and customs of others.&amp;quot;


Lucia Alinea from the Philippines, has been in the UAE for a few months only, but she is well aware of the clause. &amp;quot;My brother has been here for many years and he is aware of the Sharia law. &amp;quot;I tried to learn as much about the customs and traditions here before leaving the Philippines. We have to respect the law here or anywhere,&amp;quot; said Lucia, who is a teacher in a private school in Sharjah.

You don't need the opinion of a lawyer you need to take the sound advice you have been give here. This is the law! However, you are a grown man and have to take decisions on your own at your own risk and that of your girlfriend.

			<RelCBody>compu - the answer to your question is: it doesn't make any difference. it is illegal for people of different sexes who are not related (marriage / family) to share accommodation ;o)


by the way... why would a woman want to live with a guy without getting married?

- she's missing out on a ring and other perks that wifes get!
- she still does all the work that a wife would, again... without the perks that wife would have
- and finally there is this risk she'd take here...
... plus a guy will no see a reason to marry her since she's already doing the job!

			<RelCBody>first she should converted to muslim, and she needs to provide:- birth certificat, singleness cerficate &amp;amp; No objetion letter from her parents, Singleboth should be certified through Foriegn ministry.

The guy should have also singleness certificate from his country and should be certified by the FM.

Then go to court near Mannai R/A and provide all the documents then they will give you a appointment.

Good luck :)</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Yes friend you can, somebody think that she have to change her religion to muslim, that is not true , as she is a Christian lady, she can worship the God as per Christian instructions, and Islam religion respect other religion specially christian , so no problem at all.the verse versa is prohibited , but if a muslim lady wants to married a christian man , not allowed and everybody know the reason.
Go ahead , enjoy life , and count from 1 to 10 while you ask this question: can I control my kids believing in future? what is her attitude when you get up early to prey alfajr, what type of food you will share together , what about Ramadan fasting ....so many questions.

and the most importent question : why you fail to find an Egyption lady ?

mostly it's about family gathering, having lunch together, and going out in groups I guess.

As for Doha, it's gonna be my first Eid here, so I'll just wait and see how it will be... :)</RelCBody>

1.Will - You must have the desire to give up your habit of smoking and create a strong will to avoid a smoking relapse.

2.Mindset  You must learn about the effects of smoking, understand its consequences and face the fact that you need to stop smoking and follow, finish and maintain a quit smoking plan.

			<RelCBody>My Frnd,

The basic failure to quit smoking is firmness. People wants to quit smoking not because they wish, but because it is injures to health. If you really wish from your bottom of heart, then chances to quit smoking is more. But if is because someone is insisting or due to health reason, then you may really need more efforts.

I wish you success.

Does the QL members agree on the aove point.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Hello,

Quitting is easier said than done for most smokers. I am like you until last year. Used to finish 20 sticks a day.Started this habit since 1987 until 2010.

I tried sometimes to quit but usually they are either due to my girlfriend nagging or jus trying. Usually even with success on stopping for a week, I resume again, sometimes 3 months and picked up the habit.

You will have to decide and discipline yourself. Even a puff....

From what I can remember, I used a combination of sub-concious method:-

1) I do not stick with one brand of cigarette switch around also between heavy and light ones but toward light ones more. And I by when I finish...never maintain a backup pack or reach from friends. (this has impact; I noticed almost immediately I hate the different brands and sometime even dislike the brand this is good cos you are still holding the cigarette but smoke less as you &amp;quot;hate&amp;quot;d the taste)

2) Started some simple exercise like jogging or any sports (good preparation to clear your body with the nicotine). Make it a habit even if you are still smoking now.

3) Break the normal habit especially after food, during a tea or coffee, replace with fruits or chewing gum or just drink water.

4)  3 months after step 1) to 3) Start to take a small sip of the cigarette followed with a long and slow breath (feels like nothing initially but discipline yourself. do not stop your exercising.

5) Reduce the intake to one packet for few days or a week. Keep this target...when you have achieve this...you can decide anytime...when you want to light up another...think of the effort you have put in; start calculating the cigarette you had spend your money on and target something to buy to reward yourself....QR6x365 day is about QR1900 !!


I think the rest would be easier... I do not know if this will work for you...but I am absolutely smoke free, I still do jogging and plays the table tennis without the need to catch my breath as much and I rewarded myself an extra trip back home!

You and anyone else can do the same...No luck needed but good effort and determination. Proof others that you can have self-control, good discipline control and strong will power! You will benefit repect with the achievement, sense of achievement, regain your stamina, less sugar needed in your tea or coffee, you will have less body odour, no need to worry about smiling with a stained tooth with a smell!

			<RelCBody>Dear Friend,

First of all let me tell you that there is nothing wihich can stop you from smoking other than your WILL TO GIVE UP SMOKING.


You need to first understand what is the thing which make you smoke.
1. your mindset : It wants support! support of some kind which will give peace to your mind during tension / stress / anger etc. In case of smokers its &amp;quot;smoking&amp;quot; So you have to build your own support mechnism : like Music (which ever you like) any physical activiy like cycling, exercise, playing tennis , football, swimming anything...and that u only can identify.

2. Nicotine Cycle / Levels of Nicotine in blood: This is the nicotine content in the blood which gets lowered and bue to which the necotine which is absorbed by your lungs enters into your blood through your lungs (alveolies) and carried into the blood stream through arteries to Heart and pumped to Brain through arteries. this whole process is called as Nicotine cycle. This nicotine when reaches you brain gives you FEELING OF EASE, HAPPINESS, CLAM, WARMTH AND LOWERS YOUR STRESS, TENSION ETC ETC.... WHICH IS IN SHORT CALLED AS PLESURE..once your nicotine content in the blood decreases then you feel urge to smoke. if you break this cycle of necotine then you can quite the smoking.

3. Use Nicorette Chewing Gums: For first few weeks of quitting the smoking...its really difficult to avoid smoking...because as soon as necotine content in the blood gets decreased you feel urge to smoke. But now there are Medicinal Chewing Gums available in Pharmacy store which contains Necotine in small amount and which can be used as a replacement / as medicine for avoiding smoking during those initial days of quiting smoking.
What you need to do is first of all throw away all the accesories like lighter, cigarette case etc which you are handling for smoking by yourself and get these Nicotine contained chewing gums handy..when you feel like smoking just chew this chewing gum as an alternative. This also needs WILL.

4. Avoide visiting those places from where you purchase the cigaretts.


5. Let everybody know in your surrounding that you have quite smoking so that they do not smoke in front of you. Also tell your spouse so that he /she will support you when you need him / her the most.

6. TELL YOURSELF THAT &amp;quot;QATAR&amp;quot; IS A NO SMOKING COUNTRY AND SMOKING HERE IS A CRIME AS LIKE DRINKING LIQOUR WITHOUT VALID LICENSE.

I AM ALSO SMOKING BUT I AM SURE KNOWING ALL THIS I WILL DEFINATELY QUITE ONE FINE DAY.

if you still want to smoke then you SMOKE NOT 20 BUT MANY MORE CIGERETTES PER DAY . ITS YOUR WISH AND WILL ;)\

wishing you a smoke free life ahead.

QADOC

			<RelCBody>Its actually surprisingly EASY if you WANT to stop smoking!! 


I quit after nearly 23 years of smoking when I found out that I was pregnant.  Years and years of my family nagging me, bribing me, beggin me ... always the fear of the &amp;quot;side effects&amp;quot; if I had to quit and the hard headed insistance that I liked smoking and it was my outlet from stress and yabba yabba ... 


I was honestly pissed off with myself when I did stop and the truth hit home how much damage I had done to myself and to my relationships for so long and all FOR NOTHING!!  There was no cold turkey, no shakes, no cough, no sudden uncontrollable energy, no sudden weight gain, etc. etc.  What did happen? Anxiety and stress LEFT!!  And the smell of stale smoke and the taste of it became more repulsive than ever.  And I suddenly was open to socialising with people that didn't smoke! It was actually annoyingly easy to stay quit!  Didn't need Zyban, nicorettes, mouth spray or anything.

I had started reading Alan Carr's book &amp;quot;The Easy Way to Stop Smoking&amp;quot; after my sister bought it for me years before.  Never finished reading it and didn't read it at the time of quitting but can recommend it for you or anyone trying to quit in that it makes light reading and has some very good inspirational facts to get your mind in the right place, help it be something that you want to do. 


You don't have to smoke.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>I quit two years ago. Was quite tough. I used nicotine chewing gums for first few days.

			<RelCBody>Ok Dr. SMOKE is in the house.

Fireheartin, look before you make such a big mistake of your life stop to reconsider this whole &amp;quot;giving up&amp;quot;. What are you going to gain by giving up smoking? Live healthier? Live longer? lol these are all myths to giving up smoking just to make you feel better about yourself.


Its not easy to give up smoking depending on how long you have been smoking. Also WHY! why put your body through such mental and physical stress to resist the urge to have that beautiful puff! let me list out a few advantages of smoking

1. Taking a crap in the morning is so much more relaxed and mentally soothing when your on the throne with a ciggie. Its just comes out better.
2. Say your the only guy who doesnt smoke and all your other friends smoke, you'll be looked as that &amp;quot;loser&amp;quot; guy. Your not a loser when you smoke, you make MORE friends when you smoke. Imagine your Boss walks up to you one day and asks you for a light and you say &amp;quot;sorry i dont smoke, i've given up smoking as its bad for health&amp;quot; You just lost your chance of getting a promotion buddy.
3. Sometimes at a bar or club the best thing you can do is light up a ciggie for chick and show that your such a gentle man, or if you cant think of any stupid pick up lines a offering up a ciggie or asking her for a light is always the easiest way to start a conversation.
4. Relieving mental stress, very good to clear your mind for those 5 mins of smoke time, enjoy the beauty of nature and the chirping of birds etc.

i can just go on and on but you get the point. If your worried about dying young trust me you could get hit by a car and die tomorrow its all FATE! My dad is a smoker and still going strong...worry kills you not smoking!

Good Fortune always comes knocking at your door...when you are sh*tting in the toilet!! :)

smoking patches available in most pharmacies.

Nothing will help you quit smoking but yourself.

I was a smoker 5+ years ago..

Here are my experiences:

1- I use to smoke 1 packet a day and reduced gradually to 4 cigs a day hoping that I will break free. THIS APPROACH FAILED.

2- Tried smoking patches. It ran my throat dry and I felt like hypnotised. Bad remedy really. THIS APPROACH FAILED.

3- Determination. When I use to smoke, i leave the office to smoke and interrupt work, i make my car smelling cigarrets, it destroyed my health and i become like a dog after running for a minute or so. So I decided to stop smoking no matter what because I said to myself that all consequences and health issues that affect me from smoking have to stop. This solution WORKED!!!

You have to convince yourself that you must stop.

Don't fool urself thinking u r addicted and cannot stop.

It is an addiction but you can live normally without it.

I stopped smoking suddenly without issues.

When you stop smoking, your return to it is a matter of the first cigs after stopping. If you decide to reward urself after few months, you will become a smoker and back to square.1.

The advantages and gains from stopping smoking are really worth it.
Hope this helps.

Good luck and let me know if you need further help.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>We didn't get charged anything extra at this end.  Give a note to the courier company stating it's personal belongings and you will be taking them back when you leave Qatar, then they will give it to customs.  Hopefully, you won't get charged either.

			<RelCBody>Find a good forwarder in the UK who could deliver your stuff door-to-door (that's DDP, Delivered Duty Paid for Incoterms 2000), so receiver should not worry about anything to pay as shipper will pay all the charges before it can be shipped out from the UK to Qatar.


DHL, UPS and Fedex can handle this kind of shipment, just dont forget, Shipping Terms should be DDP in the Airway Bill.

btw, April weather starts to warm, hot season's peak July and August

			<RelCBody>Thanks for all the comments. My question regarding gas BBQ is if I can get the tank refilled and if the connections will be the same.

I didn't even consider charcoal/brickette grills since I didn't think you can get coal/brickettes in Doha. Is it widely avilable?</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>briquettes are widely available as are a variety of makes and models of charcoal bbqs.  I would say good gas grills are expensive compared to Canada, the US and Australia but are becoming more available.

As for compatibility, I have the charcoal grill (all I need is lighter fluid) but I understand there are serious issues with North American gas grill compatibility but someone else would have to speak to the specifics.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Bring it with you.  We purchased one from Lowes and had it shipped unassembled (still in the box) and don't regret it one bit.  I do recommend having a cover for it else the dust and grit will quickly work its charm.  You can change the hoses and connections fairly easily once you arrive. The canisters are larger in Doha than they are in the U.S., so don't count on the tank fitting under your grill.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>I've sent n received too many times with all of them.Each time i experienced to send sensetive papers as you meantioned.But what I noticed that DHL is the fastest one incase you have limited time n hurry for something.

And as a personal view I say all are safe enough and well servicing.The worse thing is ;you have to pick up ur stuff from their office after they informed u that you have a shipment.Would be better if they could delivery at the door.

wish you the best.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>I use eBay in conjunction with Aramex for shipping. Some sellers on eBay will ship direct to Qatar as well. You will need to decide if it's wiser to spend the extra on shipping or perhaps buy locally.

Aramex are a cost effective shipper from the states and the UK. When you join their Shop &amp;amp; Ship service they give you a postal address in the USA and UK. You have you items delivered to that address, and then they forward your goods to a depot here at reasonable rates.

I don't think selling items on eBay is a viable option from Qatar. But somebody else may think otherwise.

			<RelCBody>Ebay is good.. two things. mind where you are buying the stuff from.
if you are buying from china or Hongkong, then the seller would ship the item to Qatar with HK post which is cheap and most of the times he offers it free, but the wait time is minimum one month and 45 days is normal. you can opt to get it by HK registered post too with additional shipping cost ranging from $4 to $20, which is much faster and secure.

if you are buying from other countries like US, the standard shipping is done with USPS which is no better than HK post, its take a month too, alternatively if you opt to get it shipped with UPS/DHL/FedEx from the buyer, then price for shipping ranges anywhere from $140.

alternatively to buy from the US seller is Easyshop by DHL, or shop n ship by Aramex. check their website to know how they work.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Thanks, shyams. I am thinking of trying the one I listed above just to see how it works. I think it is in Qatar, so the shipping may be better.


I think I will try to sell something first, because the site looks so new - there aren't too many things to buy. I'll let you know how it goes.</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Well, are you new to Qatar? The answer is yes, just a few months back Qatar was visited by these dust storms from the north, ofcourse they weren't Red but it lasted for about 4-5 days, in this part of the world these (dust storms) are referred to as Al-Shamaal (pardon the spelling)
Usually this happens in Qatar right after i was my car, i really don't know why....it breaks my heart!</RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>1. don't buy too famous brands. they are not offering anything extra
2. look for the best configuration that suits your needs.
3. Personally i recommend Dell, Lenovo, Acer and Asus.
4. Depending on your budget you should look for the best options.

At the moment the best configurations that don't cost that much are core i5 Second Generation, 4 GB ram, 500+ GB Hard-Drive, 15.6 inch screen. The graphic card is a plus but not mandatory since i5 second generation has a pretty good integrated graphics (basically the better the CPU the better the graphics performance).

So at this time i would recommend:
Dell inspiron 15r: i5 SG, 500GB, 4 GB RAM, GT525M - 1GB graphic memory - this was bought by a friend of mine from sofitel with 2300QR.

Something cheaper than that:
Acer has some laptops that are very cheap but give very good performance. They are using some old CPU's brought back to life by the Second Generation from Intel (like Celeron).

This i have right now:
Acer Aspire 5349: Celeron b800 (dual-core), 2Gb ram, 320 GB HDD, 15.6&amp;quot; - bought also from sofitel with 1350 QR.
The performance is good since i'm playing games on it.


Now to answer:
What to look for:
Brand: NO! NOT EVER! brand is just a name and a logo. usualy that means increased prices just for the fact that u are a privileged user (like Apple MacCrap)
Design: Nope... u are buying to use not to look at it.
Price: Of course... Money counts after all
CPU: nowadays a dual core is the people's choice. so i5 Second Generation is a good option
RAM: preferably more than 2GB. Personally i recomend 4
HDD: Don't look only at the size, this time the brand also counts a lot! Look for Western Digital! At the moment they are the world leader in this business.
Screen Size: 15.6&amp;quot; is enough. You also have to think about resolution. Smaller than that and you have 2 icons that occupy all your Desktop Space. Bigger than that and you will buy a monster hard to carry around.
Color: Please... that is a personal pleasure... i like mine black... But please don't look for the pink Sony Vaio's (lady's you know what i mean!). It's just some paint... i can do that pink on any brand with a can of spray-paint. </RelCBody>

			<RelCBody>Brand doesn't matter? I don't think so.
Beat these...
1. My HP LAPTOP is TURNED ON 24/7 since May 2008.

2. I use it daily to watch movies (Bluray &amp;amp; 1080p movies).

 3. Downloading most of the time.
4. It's turned on even if I'm not home.
5. Turned off only when I need to restart it after an update.
6. Always relied on it to retrieve important files.
Basically it's processor is BUSY 24/7
Thanks HP.

			<RelCBody>listen, if your gaming is your top priority , then u must prepare a good budget for it, i'd reccomend an alienware m15x but its a bit more expensive than laptops in carefour(they stink for gaming actualy) so buy a :

2gb ram(dont worry u dont need more than that)
2.5ghz core 2 duo proccessor
nvidia 9800m gt 512 mb

and dont worry about running heavy games (gow,cod4.ut3....etc) on it ,it will work at max res and highest settings....

			<RelCBody>Actually u should specify what r u looking for in a labtop
Quality: Sony or Fujitsu Siemens
Price: I dont really know
Efficiency: Dell
High Spec.: HP

me (TAMUQ student) and my father (senior computer coder or progammer, u name it) are working on HPs

I have a 64-bit quad core 3.6ghz processor (which I have never heard anyone seen it before, and a 640gb disk with a 17&amp;quot; touch screen (thats a labtop not a desktop) I baught last summer for about 7 8 thousand QRs, my father's is even better, same speed and ram and everything, but the capacity is 2tb, he baught it from Russia.

But, HP has a problem of a lil bit unstability, no, thats not the word, I dont know what it is. the thing is that although its way too fast and so advanced, I didnt feel its speed, I have the 1530 Dell (my sister's) and compared to mine and dad's, its so down in the specs and I really enjoy how fast it goes, so thats the differency, efficiency and High specs, so its ur call. I would say go for HP.</RelCBody>

All of the parts of these laptops are made in china now .. as we all know china is producing every thing .. The one i prefer is Fujitsu Siemens &amp;quot;Made in Germany&amp;quot; i like it a lot .. 


but also like lance12 has told u .. it depends on what is the purpose of buying a laptop .. that will let us give u the suitable specifications and u can search among the brands to find the best one and suitable price for u ..

			<RelCBody>Sony VAIO is the best as it is built around a Blue Ray Disk drive, one that can write 25Gb of data on a DVD.
BD Drives have better visual &amp;amp; audio capability than HD Drives.

followed by Toshiba's Qosimos series.

3rd is Apple. Strangly apple does not talk about HD-drives or BD-drives!

			<RelCBody>What do you want to do with it?

Everytime I buy a laptop,I ask myself :
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
Do I need it to read memory cards?
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
Do I need a DVD writer?
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
Does it have Windows XP drivers? (I still don't like Vista)
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
My rule is not to buy Sony Vaio (the keyboard reminds me of a fisher-price toy I had in the 70s) or Acer, and current specs are 2GB of RAM, 15&amp;quot; screen (9-14 is too small, 17/19 too huge).
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
Most of the other specs are standard (Wireless, Mousepad, Speakers...).
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

			<RelCBody>When you buy it, make sure the warranty is global or worldwide.

Atif242, yes you don't have to pay tax when you buy the item, but tax was paid on the item when it was imported to Qatar and that is definitely passed down to you in the form of retail price.

Might be a little cheaper in the UK because they probably import in huge quantities unlike Qatar.

But none can beat laptop prices in the US :-)</RelCBody>
