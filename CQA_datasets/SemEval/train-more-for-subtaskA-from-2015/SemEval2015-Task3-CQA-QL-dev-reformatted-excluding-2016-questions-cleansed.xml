			<RelCText>depends on where the accommodation is.. how many people will live with you; what kind of food. Why dont u ask your company to provide you transportation and ask for 4k more as accommodation and food allowance. Most importantly; 8k isnt a great salary but it all again depends on your job profile and work experience.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If the company is from Oil and Gas Industry or working for that Industry; then their accommodation and transport will be better.

			<RelCText>The camp at NDIA is not too bad. Cabins are only a few years old and there are plenty facilities. Transport will be the yellow bus between camp and site - about 15 minutes driving max. Taxis tend not to call there so getting out on your own can be a hassle unless you get pally with a kabayan with a pickup truck at his disposal! If the salary is same as you get in Dubai you should be able to save more here.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>there has been much press lately about the drop in prices; food; and especially housing prices have been decreasing. So if you bring up a need for an increase in your allowances and salary right now; you probably won't get very far; maybe even have allowances decreased! There is something called the Qatar Statistics Authority at http://www.qsa.gov.qa/eng/index.htm May be helpful; but not sure. The English spelling in their reports is atrocious; they even spell literacy wrong! Makes me wonder about errors in their methodologies and data collection if they can't get even that right.</RelCText>

When you climb the flyover that is after you pass the Sheik Faisal Museum take immediate right and come back 500 meters on the service road (Parallel to the main road) it is next to Shahaniya Sports Club. You will find a small board Arab Qatari Agriculture company something like that. The timings are 7.00-12.30 &#38; 2.00-4.00. I'm not so sure about the afternoon timings. They also sell some fresh vegitables that they produce in the farm. You will find variety of plants there. They are also cheap compared to the ones that you get here in Doha.

			<RelCText>If you have time and you're a patient person; please go for HSBC. It takes in average 30 minutes to reach someone when you call the customer service! And if you call after 5 PM; after waiting 30 minutes they will ask you to call the day after. Another one from HSBC; if you travel abroad; they may eventually block your credit card (for security reason) and will inform you only when you are back in Qatar. I was left in Thailand without being able to use my credit card and didnt had a single $ to buy food! Thanks to HSBC. I moved to Commercial Bank (CBQ) and I'm very happy :-)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thanks for re-opening this question. NO! There is no private JUDO clubs except the federations without proper motivations for their players.

			<RelCText>Good Day! Finally I found a Judo Club that started accordingly more than a year ago. The Dojo is under umbrella of the KARATE ACADEMY in Al Sadd Area near to Jarir Book Store and Doha Clinic Hospital. The Timing of the practice is SUN-TUES-THURS at 18:30-19:45 under Coach Saeed who is a former Qatar Olympic player for 12yrs. If you are interested you can contact these nos: 4421142 or 5220806.

			<RelCText>Dottymum; Sorry for the late reply. I teach judo at a school; and no; your child is too small for my club because five years old is the bare minimum to start judo; otherwise; the judo club becomes a day care. I would start with the Qatari Judo Federation. They seem to be pretty good with the kids. I haven't worked out with the adult players; because they are always training elsewhere. But the few times I've gone to visit them; there were kids working out. Tunisians are the instructors; and if your game to learn (or already know) French; I would enroll them in their program. They seem very qualified. It's an Arabic/French class at one of the local sports clubs around the Dafna area. Let me know; and I can try to get you contacted with the right people.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>German Engineer with PhD; salary?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi all; I am seriously considering moving to Qatar. I've just finished my PhD in civil engineering (Geotechnics); I have only 1 year experience. I am German. How much should I expect in Qatar now? Do you think it is better if I work here in Germany for like 5 years before i relocate? Starting salary for civil engineers in Germany is about 10000 QR; so not really much! Best regards</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>I'm not acquainted with German work environment; but the whole thing looks like a joke to me. You are a civil engineer who dedicated at least 5 post-graduate years (not working in parallel) with no point or project behind your Ph.D. thesis other than getting the certificate!!!!!! And still you think that European degrees are better than Egyptian for instance.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>A Ph.D. civil engineer is expected to have the same starting salary as a B.Sc. holder!! Never to mention the expectation of the field work; is he supposed to be a site Engineer for example? Isn't he supposed to be working in the research field? With this starting salary for a Ph.D. Emg. in Germany; I'd recommend you'd better apply to a job in Egypt.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My experience with Eurodollar: I asked them about what happens if there is a minor scratch. They say that there are sometimes charges of 20/30 QR. A few weeks later; the car needed to come into service. The car had small scratch on front bumper. They make a big deal of it even though I am pretty sure it was there before I hired it. After service; they did not mention it and I took it out for another month. Next day they phoned me saying it would need to be charged at 450 QR! I tell them that they are taking the piss and ask to speak to the manager. A man phones later and insists I pay it claiming I need things like police reports etc - when I refuse he tells me to return the car. I say no problem if you give me back my money for the month I have hired the car. I suggest he comes into work and picks up the car. He does not come in and does not phone again. Next day; car has a problem and won't start (it has lots of little problems due to poor servicing). They come out with new key but take much longer than they said they would. The same guy finally turns up with another who looks threateningly at me and they go straight to the scratch. I tell them my feelings that it is minor but he makes a big deal about needing to get the whole bumper re-sprayed and that anybody doing the job for 100 QR (as I thought reasonable) would not do a good job. He says that as I am such a pal he will reduce it to 350 QR and that he will pay the remaining 100 QR. Basically; I have to agree to pay or there will be no new key. I take the car to the main dealers and they quote 100 QR!!!! I believe that it is not likely that the main dealers for this car model would be cheap or of a poor standard when it comes to spraying. I suggest you avoid Eurodollar as they are trying to squeeze money out of any opportunity... Even worse than the other car hire places I have tried.</RelCText>

If you own some games brought from Qatar and don't know you can just check the back of the box and see whether or not it says PAL or NTSC. Thanks in Advance :)</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Thats easy to answer. Its YES!!...Samsung is selling a model that has Dual Sim Capability (dont know th exact model;and I saw it in THE MALL) so it means theres no problem using a Dual Sim Phone. Technically. you have two numbers in one phone.as opposed to having two phones for 1st for ur roaming and 2nd for your Qtel/Vodafone number.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The Anglican church of Doha is where most "english'speaking people go to in doha. Their church building is still under construction in the Abu Hamour church complex.But their services take place in Doha English speaking school(DESK)near Markhiya round about. Entry to the place is restricted and Qatar police will be gaurding the gate always. so if you want to go you have to call the pastor and inform him so they will add your name to the list with the police.

			<RelCText>There are no Baptist churches as such in Doha. Only a handful of Christian communities are allowed to have recognized; sponsored; full-time clergy; and the Baptists are not one of them. The Emir graciously granted land to the Anglican church to lead the various independent Protestant Christian communities in Doha to contract a Protestant center. Most Baptists and evangelical Christians I know tend to go to the non-denominational Christian communities such as Doha Fellowship and Grace Fellowship. Both have webpages. Like the Anglican church (and much of Qatar for the that matter) services are conducted in English; but a fair number of participants do not speak English as their first language. Hope you find what you are looking for.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The average kennel cost is 35 -45QR per day. However; you need to book in December to get a place. Doha Vets have just opened a new facility; call them on 4367187; they may be able to help you; the price will be less if you can find someone who is prepared to share the cage with their cat (if and only if they get along well). Also check with QAWS; they may have space but you really will be very lucky to pay less than the going rate; competition for cages is strong at this time of year. There is a lady who will visit your house daily; change the litter and feed but it is very sad to leave a lone cat for a month; if you consider doing this why not offer a home to one of QAWS many cats looking for a home? Then; you can leave the cat knowing he will be happy and also giving a home to a cat who really needs it. jj</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Sorry - QAWS don't do boarding! We're a rescue shelter only. If you're looking for someone responsible and knowledgeable to care for your pet whilst you are away you will need to spend more then that. 2 months boarding in any of the catteries here in Qatar would be a minimum of QR2;400. And it would probably cost more to have someone come to your house twice a day to care for him.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>there is a different route to retrieve each type of i.d. for the qatar i.d. you first have to report it missing with the capitol police station which i believe is by souq waqf. after 7 days you go back and they will give you a paper to go and get another i.d. for the driving license; go to the traffic department that issues these; pay 100 i think it is and you'll get another one on the spot. just remember to take your passport and any other pertinent i.d. to each of these places so as not to make a wasted trip. this happened to me before; wallet was stolen out of my locked car!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>TB; you always amaze me with your confident yet ignorant answers; especially when it comes to the immigration issues. Of course ladies are allowed to sponsor their husbands. At least there is no a legal limitation on it. Yes; it's is much more difficult; than husband sponsoring his wife.. but it IS possible. It depends on few factors; and each application is considered by the authorities on case-to-case basis.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Cumbersome this rule was actually passed just a couple of days ago so it seems. I'm talking about visit visa being stopped completely for everyone; not any specific nationality. Both persons that told me this went to the airport branch. So its possible that they are no long issuing visit visa there. But its still available at the immigration office in Gharaffa?

			<RelCText>&#60;img src="http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/graphics/photos/lighthun.gif" width=350 height=180 /&#62; &#60;b&#62;Explanation:&#60;/b&#62; Calculate how many seconds when you saw the flash of lightning; until you hear thunder then divide the value by 3 to know the distance in Kilometers or divide by 5 to know the distances in Miles &#60;b&#62;Example: &#60;/b&#62; You see flashes of lightning; 12 seconds later; his voice booming. So the distance of lightning by yourself is 12 / 3 = 4 km (approximately ) When the flash light; at that time we also see it immediately; because the speed of light is very high; 299;792;458 meters per second. There's almost no delay to reach our eyes. But; the speed of sound "only" 331 meters per second. As a result; some time after the lightning lit; the new voice boomed. Therefore; the distance of lightning with thunder listeners about a mile every three seconds. Thunder is rarely heard at a distance of more than 25 kilometers. &#60;img src="http://u.kaskus.us/3/mfibgiyr.gif" width=250 height=150 /&#62; Good Article... by Aikon</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you dont know who hits you; then you are responsible to go to police dept. to make a report for the damage and you'll pay 110. They will check also if you have any violation (if you have; sadly you have to pay it or else you're not gonna get the report). Since its only TPL; sadly (again) you will bear the expenses for the repair.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The Honey Nut Cheerios almost always seem to be in stock at MegaMart - at least when I go. The regular Cheerios are more difficult to find; but they do exist. (Buy them up when you can find them!) Keep in mind that the Honey Nut Cheerios have a lot of sugar (9g per serving) compared to the regular Cheerios (1g per serving) http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/news/20081001/kids-cereals-some-are-50-percent-sugar They're not as bad as some other cereals that target kids; but they're still quite sweet.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>So funny that you asked because I've been looking for them for a while too. Here's my info: 1. Regular; plain cheerios: I've only found them at Megamart. And they cost like 23 riyals for a very small box! 2. Honey Cheerios (from Nestle): These are available at just about every grocery store like Family Food Centre; Food Palace; Lulu; Carrefour. They only cost around 13 riyals for a box. Hope this helps.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I was going to write the same thing as NY couple. In Family food centre you can occassionally get vanilla cheerios which do well on the taste buds but are a bit on the expensive side - like 35 riyals.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Oh and don't buy into that wholegrain healthy crap that all these cereals advertised. They're all still pretty heavily processed. Best healthiest thing to do for breakfast is eat as much protein as you can - hence eggs are highly recommended.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Cheerios are processed - absolutely. However; on an overall basis they're much healthier than most of the other garbage out there that is marketed to mums for their babies &#38; toddlers. The sugar content of plain ol' Cheerios is also far lower than that of sugared cereals and other snacks; which are generally even more processed than Cheerios. Some of the sugared cereals are up to 50% sugar (by weight - and more than that as a % of calories). Even some of the yogurts have more grams of sugar per serving than a full-sized can of Coke; thanks to all the added sugar (and high fructose corn syrup). Plain unsweetened/unflavored yogurt does contain natural sugar; as does fruit; but nowhere near the sugar levels of the typical "fruit" yogurt here in Qatar. Nothing is ever truly perfect in the snack food world; but we can strive for "the best we can find". . .I just try to read the labels and use common sense :o)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Don't get me wrong doody. I myself have honey cheerios at home which I on occasion eat cause they're quite tasty. What I meant to say; though it didn't come across properly; was that the advertising campaign that Nestle cheerios has is over exaggerated. Companies like nestle tend to amplify what little nutritional value their products have to convince consumers to buy them. Like expat sueno says; they are a bit healthier than the other stuff out there but at the same time they're still not that healthy. Anyway I don't mean to be a diet Nazi; you should eat what you wish :) Oh and I have to agree with Doratheexplorer; I'm not sure about giving cheerios to a baby you'd have to check up on that.</RelCText>

If it's a bank loan then notify the bank immediately that you have been terminated and let them know you are actively searching for a new job in order to be able to repay the debt. Best of luck!!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Nothing fatal! Find another job and keep paying your loan; what's the problem? Loan and credit cards have nothing to do with your sponsorship. Unless your company cancelled your RP... then your current company must inform your bank; and they will simply freeze your account until you find another job. Nothing extraordinary. If you want to leave for good; you will have to pay off your loan. Then sell your car and close the outstanding balance; that's it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Both are the same standard. Decent Quality and decent prices (on sale). Try out this new furniture shop in this new mall come up adjacent to la cigale hotel - al saad.This mall has benetton; BHS etc. On the first level is this furniture shop - it had great looking furniture (The one; id design standard but with home center prices). I have already furnished my place but this is one recommended buy. Doesn't have too much of choice though but since it is a one off shop there are high chances of you do end up having the same furniture as your neighbour (which is a high probabiliy with home center/homes r us)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I think they both are having the same quality ... mostly Chinese or Veitnamees ... it depnd on the materials .. if it is solid wood or rubber wood then it is diffirent from MDF and so on ... now u have a chance to buy from Home cemter because they have special offer ... buy 250 and get 50 . according to ur budget u will be able to move . I personally prefer home center which I furnished my house here and back home from it . they have more branches and more options to chose . good luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Most of the replies are so funny. When the guy is asking a simple question answer with relevance. No pal Tata Sky does not work so well during the day due to Solar Disturbance. Dont listen to the QTEL's self proclaimed spokesmen who speak only crap. Nothing will happen if you use Tata Sky. I dont find it illegal at all since it does not air porn channels but pure family entertainment. Secondly its been registered and paid for services. There should be no harm using it as long as you dont bother QTEL. QTEL should not be bothered as they provide useless TV channels in Doha; unlike in Dubai PEHLA Network is facing losses due to customer switchover. If it is illegal; then please talk with facts where in Qatar QTEL pulled out the dish antennas for Tata SKY. No one cares. Dream Box is still flooded in the market and that should be something QTEL should ban as its a portal for obscene channels..</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Family visa application question:</RelQSubject>

Now I checked at 1 pm and it still shows under process but in a different way and also shows expiry date; application date etc...but the visa number is not there! Does this mean I have to go to immigration to pay the fees?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Hi Dear; Wishing you Happy New Year 2012. Yes you have been allotted with Visa but its still undergoing few formalities like Final Signature from Signing Authority and Security Clearance. You should go to immigration department and show them the application receipt. They will let you know the exact status. Once everything is done...the status will be changed to "Ready for Printing" and later you can get it printed either from MOI website or get the printed copy from Immigration Dept. Hope this answers your question. All The Best.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>as jackmohan said what kind of wedding is it? usually arabic weddings are shot by female photographers who are not very professional..as camera is not allowed inside the wedding halls they have a seperate section for photoshoot and the shots are mostly potraits done with a single backdrop. if you put down some details.. i can direct you to some of them.

			<RelQSubject>My CDs were confiscated at Qatar land border</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hello. We just realized that our lifetime CDs of photos and weddings were missing. It was 2 months ago after our boxes were land freight to Doha from Dubai. We tried to contact the custom authorities; our shipping agents; and ask how to go about to claim it back. So far; we haven't had any luck. Does anyone has this experience before? Would love to hear from you and your comments. Thanks</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Thanks for the comments. I am hoping that someone can give me some advice how and where to claim this item back. This is the first time we ever ship through land freight. We always used air cargo in the past and our CDs went through just fine. They questioned us; but never confiscate. The guy who we dealt with never informed us verbally nor in in writing about restrictions. The drivers didn't care whether our things were confiscated. Anyway; it's not that important to blame anyone. I just want to get my CDs back. Most of our boxes were torn apart. We lost all of our medicines even children vitamins and other things. However; we didn't mind as these can be replaced. Our lifetime photos cannot unfortunately.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes; you can get the liquor license if you hold a valid RP in QATAR. You just need a letter from your sponsor stating your designation with your salary (All Allowances Must Be Included); Copy of RP from your passport; QR.1000/- (One time deposit).. Go to QDC; fill up the form; submit all the above. If approved; you will be granted the permit in 15min.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Of course assuming you are a muslim; I think you have no chance of getting a liquor license.

			<RelCText>TENS means Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator. It is commonly used in Physical Therapy depts as a modality to treat denervated muscles like those in stroke or spinal injury patients. These are the ones you see with pads connected to the muscles to make it twitch or on higher frequency; to relieve pain. However; this machine should only be operated by a licenced physiotherapist with the supervision of a doctor. Untrained use of TENS might result to electrocution accidents.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>most schools would tell you what type of accomodation they provide at least - for example single/one bedroom fully furnished flat. Also; if they are an ongoing operation; they probably already have the flats rented and should be able to provide more particulars (i.e. photos). As for getting paid; no matter the status of your residency; they should be paying you while it goes through the bureaucracy; reputable employers do that. If for some reason you don't get an RP then they should also tell you what happens at that stage (repatriation at the school's expense).</RelCText>

			<RelCText>This is one good article i found on net. Is Halal meat Halal? The title of this article is a bit misleading. I do eat halal meat but only that which I have either slaughtered myself or from someone I know; trust and am confident can slaughter an animal properly. This may come across as a rather elitist viewpoint but it is only that - my viewpoint which I admit is more personal that strictly religious. In my early years of Islam meat was just that; meat. I; like everyone else; simply looked for the halal logo on a packet of meat; the shop window or restaurant. I consumed a reasonable amount of meat per week. However things started to change. On one hand I started to realise that the phrase "you are what you eat" is literally true. I noticed a huge difference in my health; outlook and religious state after periods of being vegetarian. On the other hand I started to question whether halal meat was actually halal. I wondered whether we could actually trust the butchers; the producers or even the slaughter man in the abattoir. I also questioned whether the intensive exploitation of animals rested comfortably with my understanding of Islam. I concluded that there was too much doubt involved and decided to follow the advice of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his noble family) to leave that over which I had doubt. At one point my family had pretty much turned vegetarian. Meat rarely entered our house and the only time we ate meat was at friends' houses. Although vegetarianism is to be applauded and even encouraged; I do believe that some meat is healthy. All the Prophets ate meat with the grandfather of them all Ibrahim (peace be upon him) offering the sacrifice we still commemorate every year at the end of Hajj. Upon moving to the countryside our ambition to produce; slaughter and eat our own meat finally came true. We used to buy lambs from farmers; I would slaughter them and have someone butcher it ready for the freezer. We even started to breed our own chickens. The meat was fantastic; not only did it taste different but it looked and felt different. The texture and colour of real meat! One of the benefits of living in the countryside is that you meet people that work in agriculture; these are the people that bring us our vegetables and meat. Through speaking to them I started to find out some things about both animal farming and supposed halal meat. Animals are exploited. If one sees the conditions they are born; bred and die in it would horrify anyone with a good heart. Chickens lead miserable lives in huge sheds; sharing their space and air with thousands of others. They do nothing but feed and get fat as fast as possible ready to make their way to supermarkets selling them as "Value" meat or to a Chicken Cottage on the high street. Larger animals face similar problems. Lambs are pumped full of steroids to make sure they don't die; ewes with hormones so they give birth out of season and both feed on grass treated with insecticides. Cattle are sometimes born and bred in sheds; they never see daylight or eat a blade of grass. Muslims need to ask whether this is something they are truly happy eating. Is it good to eat meat that is full of rubbish; that led a miserable life and a stressful end? Is it not possible that all this transfers into the meat? One also needs to ask if this method of farming sits with the ethos and spirit of Islam. Does Islam not teach compassion; kindness and does it not fight exploitation? To me both these elements make most of the meat in the UK inedible. I do not want to subject my body to such produce and I definitely do not want to contribute towards an industry that exploits a community that praises Allah (Quran 13:15; 17:44 and 22:18). Through an increasing interest in the whole area of meat; animal welfare and organic food I wanted to see whether local abattoirs would be open to me coming in and slaughtering animals. My talks and visits to some local abattoirs confirmed all my previous suspicions about halal meat in the UK. The first abattoir I ever called told me that there was no problem in coming and doing halal meat as they already had someone who did that. Upon questioning the abattoir it turned out that he man who did that was Muslim but did not slaughter them himself but processed them normally; meaning they were killed by non-Muslims. "He reads a prayer on them or something then gives them to us;" were the exact words. Another local abattoir informed me that "all we do is halal meat". Again after some probing I found out that none of the slaughter men were Muslim. The abattoir had actually entered into a deal with a Muslim who was processing them in this tucked away abattoir and selling the meat as halal. As you can imagine I was shocked. So as you can see; there are some people out there that do not seem to have a conscience. They are pumping out thousands of carcasses of haram meat to butchers and restaurants and you are eating it. However; my problems with halal meat do not stop there. I also question the hygiene standards of a lot of Muslim owned abattoirs. The vet at my abattoir once said to me that he has seen places in Birmingham that were "covered in shit". "How can you call that halal?" he asked me. My other issue is with the slaughter men. As someone who visits an abattoir every week and does between 10-30 lambs I know your mind drifts. It makes me question whether those that work as slaughter men full -time really remember to say "Bismillah - Allahu Akbar" or even pay attention to what they are doing. This is not their fault but a consequence of the high demand for meat and the need to process so many animals per day. As a result of all this thinking; research and experience I have made an oath not to eat halal meat ever again unless I know exactly where it has come from. I am not advocating that everyone does this as I appreciate this is not always possible; but to anyone who has taken the time to read this I would ask you to really question your relationship to meat. The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) are known to have made themselves sick upon discovering that the source of some food was doubtful. A lot of my conclusions are purely personal. I wish modern day Sheikhs and scholars would address the issues of intensive farming; animal rights and what we eat. This whole area is sadly lacking and needs to be examined in order to give us some guidelines. At the end of the day those that simply want meat can put their trust in a logo. It is those that want something better; for themselves; their children and animals; that need to start thinking about the meat they eat and taking some tough decisions. by Muhammad Ridha Payne Thanks.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The chances that the Swine Flu virus spreads in Qatar are pretty low. That doesn't mean that you can be careless. There is not a vaccination to that particular flu yet; according to what I've read in the news (and I'm quite into reading news about swine flu; since I'm from Mexico and have all my family and friends there) is that the vaccination for Swine Flu will be ready from 4 to 6 months time. Just take care; try to keep you and your baby away from people who had been in affected areas in the last 3 weeks and that should do it. Don't panic!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It can be as safe or dangerous as you want it to be. Having spent 20 + years in the USA; I would say it is safe. Like someone else said; PA is large; where are you going to study? It is a beautiful state; with gorgeous rural areas; bustling city; and lots to do. Outdoor activities are great; it is a hop-skip-and-jump to the New Jersey shore; New York City; and not far to get to Montreal in Canada.

			<RelCText>i believe what you need is the authentication of your documents.

			<RelCText>by the way rey; if you mean "Authentication" or "Rid Ribbon"; you must first send back your documents to your country -Philippines and ask your relatives to stand as your representative to process the authentication in DFA Manila... there is a reminder flashes in TFC from Phil.

			<RelCText>If this is to do with her Labour Card then welcome to Labour Card Nightmare!. I am assuming you are Indian. In this case all her academic certificates (not diplomas from pvt institutions) must be sent to India for attestation from the Foreign Affairs Ministry there. Once it is back attest at Indian Embassy. Then go to MOFA and attest all over again. And all this should be done on the ORIGINAL Certifiacte and NOT copies. You can contact Asia Translation or UROGULF and they will charge Qrs. 500 per certificate. You will get it from India in 15 days;.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You need to get a letter from your employer or a utility bill. Then take to your embassy and ask exactly how you do it. For British; we have to send the certicates to a registered solicitor in the uk who stamps them; sends to uk Ministry of Foreign Affairs; then onto Qatar Embassy in London who stamps them. Once back they can be presented to CEID.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>When you retake a driving test...?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I took my first driving test this morning and managed to pass the signal; L and parking tests. However; I got screwed in the road test (don't ask). I'm planning to retake the test sometime this month. By doing so; do you go over the test from the start? Or do you start where you left off (failed)? Like me; for example; I failed the road test; so does that mean I only do the road test? Thanks!</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>yes u only have to do road test; no need to repeat from start. second thing they failed u sometimes just becoz they r allowed to pass specific quota. they cant pass evryone. they ordered to pass specific number of people. and second everybody is writing that pay some thing to instructor. no need to pay anything to instructor. simply pay 1500 riyal and get rid of test. thats it</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hai.. Of cause he has to pay fine for the extra three days; its come QR600/- See you only told that visa is for only 1month; which means only for 30 days. He has entered Qatar on 5th of January 2009; then 30 days completes on midnight of 3rd feb. 2009. Natuarlly he has to pay fine for three days. Better to avoid fine tell your friend to preponed the ticket on 3rd of feb2009. Otherwise his father can enjoy the visit and pay the fine for extra 3 days. Hope it helps you</RelCText>

			<RelCText>All puppies are cute - go to QAWS and if you meet the requirements you will most likely find a companion to love you for life.

			<RelCText>pet shop Sure; go ahead to the pet shop at Al Nasr street. buy a cute puppy. Just be informed that ALL pet shops in Doha are very unhygenic and have low (if any) standards. The animals are usually diseased and sick. My neighbor bought a kitten for christmas at this very shop. It died the next day. She had to threaten them with a call to the police in order to get a refund. QAWS is your best bet as they have trained vets to help them look over the animals in their care. Go there and get educated about pet ownership.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Qatar is indeed one of the fastest developing countries in the world. We are not living a primitive life here. However drinking Fuel is far cheaper than Mineral Water. Jokes apart; You get all kind of Mineral Water in Qatar and that too from all parts of the world. I am sure there is a brand of mineral water of Jordan as well; coz i have seen and bought Lebanese brand as well. The water is really tasty. Anyway the Tap water is very safe to drink in qatar; as long as you filter it. Water is being treated with best and latest technology here. So you need not worry. In any case you have great quality mineral water here for you to enjoy and drink ! Cheers</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The reason I mentioned the 5% was because there were signs posted all around town (last I saw one was about a month ago) advertising 5% interest on savings accounts. I believe it was QNB; but I'm not sure. Yes; I've heard similar bad things about HSBC. Looks like I'll be looking into QNB and Commercial Bank then. One of my most important requirements is seamless online access and transfers.</RelCText>

But you can find pretty much all you need; it will cost you though! I just moved her from London; and before that Japan; and i though it was expensive there! It was NOTHING compared to here...bring lots of cash if you want to eat like you do at home!There is a Marks and Spencer in Landmark mall that has nice food once in a while; bisquits and crisps and the like.

Procedures for buying are http://www.propertyfrontiers.com/research/country-guides/africa-and-the-middle-east/qatar/buyers-guide.aspx 1. Reserve the property Once you have chosen your ideal property; a reservation agreement is to be signed with the seller and a reservation deposit needs to be paid (will form part of the purchase price). 2. Mortgage Pre-assessment Even most mortgage lender grant mortgage upon the completion of a project; if mortgage is crucial for buyer; we suggest buyer to communicate with banks and have a pre-assessment on how much buyer can borrow; prior to signing of property contract. 3. Due Diligence Prior to signing of property contract; we suggest buyer to carry out a due diligence check on the developer and development on the following: the company registration certificate (if the seller is an entity) or proof of seller's identity (if the seller is a private individual) or proof of a personal who is duly authorised to sign all legal documents (if the seller is an entity or an attorney of the seller) the title certificate for the land the planning permission/consent the building licence all other relevant permissions for the commencement of the project any lien; debt; development finance; or encumbrances against the land and/or the project at least one of bank guarantee; insurance and/or assurance ensure the completion of the project or an escrow system to provide security for the buyer's property payments an independent quantity surveying (QS) system during the construction period The above due diligence check is more appropriate to be done through a local law firm or conveyancing lawyer. 4. Exchange Contract Before singing preliminary purchase contract; buyers are suggested to consult a local law firm or conveyancing lawyer on analyse the risk; any unfavourable terms of the contract. Upon signing of the contract; first instalment/payment is often required. 5. Ownership Certificate Once the property is completed; the following procedures need to be completed in order for the seller to transfer the final title to the buyer: a. Bring the title of the property to the archive office of the real estate registry b. Fill sale-purchase agreement that is available in the real estate registry c. The archive office registers the title information in the Archive database d. The seller takes the file from the archive office to the registrar office in the real estate registry e. The registrar office checks non-encumbrances f. The buyer pays the transfer fee at the real estate registry g. The notary office checks whether the seller is the owner before allowing the transfer to take place h. The director of the real estate registry office approves the transfer agreement i. The buyer takes the approved transaction to the registrar office for final records j. Buyer receives the final title in his name7</RelCText>

Also there is Lusail; a whole new city which is presently being built next to the West Bay area; and where the first apts in 'Foxhills' will be available to move into from mid 2013. These will be made up of low rise apartment buildings built around Italian style Piazzas. Additionally there are 14 other areas; within central Doha; in which you can purchase residential property or land; however these are mainly in the older and far more built up areas of Doha.

			<RelCText>As always. If you both act on a low profile the neighbors..will not complain; just state to your neighbors that you are married;; they will not know the wiser;. But as stated it is illegal; friends of mine where caught; they were put in by their neighbors. Some people have great satisfaction in reporting you to the police. As some say they pay spotters to find incidents like this; it is the fastest way to get promoted in the ranks.. It also depends on your race as well Just keep a low profile and get an apartment in a compound with a lot of westerners.

			<RelCText>You can work as an accountant; financial analyst; business process; marketing analyst; it all depends on what you want to do; what did you prefer or find yourself very familiar with while you studied Economics? Where; as in companies; there is lots of companies in Doha that will suit your degree. You can also apply in Schools as an accountant for instance. Bank would be a good choice for you too. Where; as in a good website for jobs; you can check www.bayt.com; make an account; upload your C.V and the necessary information and then look for a job there; based on either the company or the position you want.

			<RelCText>Best way to get rid of smoking habbit is gradually decrease the number. think of times when you just smoke for the heck of it; such as with cup of tea; as soon as you sit in the car etc and then avoid lighting up one at such times. chew a gum or carry a can of juice with you while in the car or outdoor.

			<RelCText>The profession you mentioned is not listed so it will be better to check with the Airlines first. They will not let you board if the profession is not eligible to get the visa on arrival. There is no credit card payment at Dubai Airport. You should buy one e-card from the bank counter for the visa charges and that is the only one the Immigration will accept and the bank will accept any valid currencies according their exchange rates.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>First- Not very advisable to put up the name of the company with your real name. Edit that part out. Second- As for the salary; it's good enough; not great but not bad either.. Families are living on 8;000 QAR as well and I meet some families moaning about only 50;000 that they get. If he is in sales; he should get a car from the company so I guess you can cross out that from your expenditure. Every sales guy in here gets one.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have bought a DELL Studio XPS just before moving to Qatar ; but returned it right away. If you're a picky user; you will be dissapointed with the amount of heat it can generate. XPS is basically a gaming machine. Then I have bought a toshiba and very very unhappy with it; sometime it just stops working. From my previous experience; IBM T series laptops are the best one; then Dell Lattitude series.Never buy Dell inspiron series; my wife got one - very cheap made laptop. Finally if you have the budget go with the Macbook Pro - it generates less heat; battery life is also good and runs on BSD Unix on the background. You can also visit CNet or Amazon.com to see some of the reviews before even choosing one. Cheers</RelCText>
